I’ve had an awful lot of documentation to read through over the previous posts
so this time I’ll throw some recommendations for different ways to ingest the
content. This includes podcasts and screencasts for all the cool kids.

## Podcasts

* [Data Skeptic](https://dataskeptic.com/): a good generalist podcast
* [Linear Digressions](https://lineardigressions.com/): this one is more
  software engineering-y than Data Skeptic
* [Partially Derivative](http://partiallyderivative.com/): alcohol and data
  science, what could go wrong? This one has finished but all the old casts are
  still good
* [Vidya's data hack](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/category/podcast/)


## Screencasts/presentations

* [Destroy All
  Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell)
  – this screencast in particular talks about how to make functional code work
  for the real world by embedding it in an imperative shell
* [Edward Kmett](https://twitch/ekmett) – regular twitch streams from the person
  responsible for Lenses (coming soon to non-haskell languages near you)
* Are you [glue](https://youtu.be/KClAPipnKqw)? Not just for software engineers,
  this is a talk from a former google employee about careers that’s getting rave
  reviews from everybody that sees it

## Articles

* [CAD designs for geometric
  ML](https://medium.com/ai%C2%B3-theory-practice-business/abc-free-datasets-for-geometric-deep-learning-5e2995768b37)
* [Automate the boring stuff 2.0!!!!!!](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48072164)
* [The 'pareto optimal gender pay
  gap'](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/610195/ubers-algorithm-for-paying-drivers-is-causing-a-gender-gap/)
  (aka When Algorithms Turn Sexist)
* [Machine learning and inference of cause](https://go.technologyreview.com/can-machine-learning-help-us-understand-why)
* A
  [trio](https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2019-05-08-list-manipulation-tricks.html)
  [of](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/hkd-options)
  [posts](https://blog.johncs.com/posts/monads-and-how-we-lie.htm) about
  functional programming and how they’re better than the other paradigms because
  you can predict the future


## The life-changers

As a counterbalance for the stupid Uber algorithm I’ll try to bring some joy by
showing those advancements which are having real positive impacts on people’s
lives

* [Identifying impaired
  speech](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/impaired-speech-recognition/)
  to give those whose voice is hard to control a means to be heard more easily
* [AI for predicting cancer and personalising
  care](https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/using-ai-predict-breast-cancer-and-personalize-care)


## Papers

* [Adversarial examples as features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02175) – this is
  really interesting, how details imperceptible to humans but work against
  algorithms could be used as features is pretty cool
* [Holistic semi-supervised learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02249)


## Title reference

A music one I'm afraid. This is the title of an EP from one of my all time
favourite bands, Godspeed You! Black Emperor (they later moved the position of
the !).

As always, if you have any suggestions for improvements, content or want to
throw me a decent appearance because I clearly have no time to make this
prettier just fire an email my way!

See you next time, Fishman out.
