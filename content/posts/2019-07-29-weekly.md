The summer holidays are here and the weather is dangerously warm. Heat is just something which completely blows my productivity out of the water so its another short post this week. Bring on the winter and evenings reading blog posts by candle-light!


## Blogs and commentary

- Smashing the NLP leaderboards with [Transformers](https://hackingsemantics.xyz/2019/leaderboards/)
- [Mapping roads with AI](https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/23/facebook-speeds-up-mapping-data-validation-with-machine-learning-tools-map-with-ai-and-rapid/) at Facebook
- [How R ladies made data science inclusive](https://qz.com/work/1661486/r-ladies-made-data-science-inclusive/) gives us some shocking statistics (did you know that only 15-25% of data scientists are women?) but shows the positive impact that a little effort in inclusivity can achieve
- As project lead for the development of Consumer and Business Price Indices I really enjoyed seeing machine learning being leveraged to [reverse engineer the Big Mac index](https://www.datascienceodyssey.com/reverse-engineering-the-big-mac-index/)


## Tools of the trade and papers
I haven't had much chance to read many papers this week so this is now a combined featurette:

- Developing skills in new languages using [codewars](https://dev.to/lukegarrigan/why-codewars-is-the-best-way-to-learn-a-new-programming-language-4216) gives a good description of how websites such as codewars and hackerrank can help you quickly understand new languages if you are already familiar with its programming paradigm.
- [Gauge Equivariant CNNs and the Icosahedral CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04615). This paper made me happy and sad in equal measure. There was lots of good geometry in there but didn't talk about Lie algebras and Lagrangians to really make me reminisce about the Gauge theory parts of my university calculus and differential geometry courses. This has the benefit of making it far more readable so don't let me put you off!


## Repositories of the week

**Note**: may or may not include Haskell propaganda as this has been the bulk of my reading this week!

- I'm sure you're all familiar with the idea of 'awesome lists' on github now, so here is one covering applications of [Machine Learning in Industry](https://github.com/firmai/industry-machine-learning)
- A haskell [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/bollu/blaze/blob/75c4ab5c17bda3b751f0d328b19064a2ce1eccfe/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb) tutorial on how a stochastic superoptimiser, a type of compiler that takes a program and finds the optimal sequence of instructions that perform the same tasks, can be built
- [Parsing with combinators](https://github.com/lettier/parsing-with-haskell-parser-combinators/tree/bf97f8b41568e4a72b659f2af79d4dedd397e32d) gives a step by step guide to parsing using combinators (which is a really great thing)
- [Mapping the structure of software design-patterns](https://github.com/thma/LtuPatternFactory/tree/85656b63d1d2cf0a0694b45458b56dec37bd76ca) to the concepts found in the Haskell type class library (and general functional programming)


## Origin of the title

It makes me sad to think that there are people who still haven't seen Little Shop of Horrors. Who doesn't love the idea of a musical featuring Rick Moranis growing a human eating plant voiced by one of The Four Tops?
