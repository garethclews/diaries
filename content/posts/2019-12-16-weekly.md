## Post of the Week


## Blogs and commentary

- A good talk by Will Kurt (of [Count Bayesie](https://www.countbayesie.com)
  fame) introducing probability for programmers. The blurb will tell you that
  the talk 'attempts to cover all of statistics in 90 minutes' and whilst that
  is really impossible it goes from 0 to generalised linear models which is
  actually pretty nifty.
