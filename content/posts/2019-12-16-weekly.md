## Post of the Week

As 2019 is coming to an end we can expect to see plenty of 'best of the year'
type posts but the one I've enjoyed the most so far is [re•work's 30 influential
videos of
2019](https://blog.re-work.co/30-pieces-of-influential-ai-research-in-2019/).

I haven't been able to make time to watch them but of the ones I have so far I
have enjoyed the experience.


## Blogs and commentary

- A good talk by Will Kurt (of [Count Bayesie](https://www.countbayesie.com)
  fame) introducing probability for programmers. The blurb will tell you that
  the talk 'attempts to cover all of statistics in 90 minutes' and whilst that
  is really impossible it goes from 0 to generalised linear models which is
  actually pretty nifty.

- Having recently re-watched The Wolf of Wall Street I found that the current
  [truth of market
  traders](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/12/10/artificial-intelligence-is-superseding-well-paying-wall-street-jobs/#43483517524d)
  is a far more sterile affair. Traders seem to be no more, replaced by
  algorithms which is far further ahead of the game than most jobs I think.
- Yoshua Bengio in an
  [interview](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/artificial-intelligence/yoshua-bengio-revered-architect-of-ai-has-some-ideas-about-what-to-build-next)
  about how general intelligence might end up being a very complicated mish mash
  of technologies built on top of each other and how he believes that's ok.
  The [AI Index
  Report](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21010671/ai-index-report-2019-machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-data-progress)
  suggests that general intelligence is still a very long way away, which
  supports the statements made by Bengio.
- The Finnish Presidency of the Council of the EU has decided to invest in
  people’s future skills and will make the [Elements of
  AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/eu2019fi) online course freely available in
  all official EU languages. English is now available! I wish this could give
  me an excuse to visit Finland but the chances are slim.
- The free press have started to pick up interviews with leading experts [to
  curb decisions created by biased
  AI](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/12/ai-end-uk-use-racially-biased-algorithms-noel-sharkey).
  This follows on from last week's post about the ICO and ATI consultation and
  it seems that there is growing fervour around explicability.


## Papers

- Google Brain's [latest paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01603.pdf) introduces
  its Dreamer model. Reinforcement learning now has an 'imagination' to predict
  how things work.


## Tools of the trade

This week is Julia heavy, which gives away the things I have mostly been doing!

- Solve [nonlinear eigenvalue
  problems](https://nep-pack.github.io/NonlinearEigenproblems.jl/) with Julia.
- Also Julia, [statically sized
  arrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl).
- Need a dependency-free Julia alternative to
  [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/)? Try
  [XLSX.jl](https://github.com/felipenoris/XLSX.jl).



## Origin of the title

Last week I went to see A Nightmare Before Christmas live. It was phenomenal.
