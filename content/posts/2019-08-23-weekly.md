This week's Fishman diary is brought to you by collective Fishpeople. Thanks all involved in keeping this running. This is a post-hoc transliteration of the email (formatting left as-is for consistency).


## Fun books

A statistics textbook combined with a graphic novel: “An adventure in statistics: The reality enigma’ by Andy Field”. Why can’t all textbooks be this engaging?

* Blog post here: https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/2016/04/28/if-youre-not-doing-something-different-youre-not-doing-anything-at-all/
* First chapter here: http://www.methodspace.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FIELD_AIS_ch-1-fin-26_04.pdf

## Cool data science stuff

Using Shapley values for explaining predictions of ML models. We train our machine learning models and get predictions. But explaining why the predicted value is what it is can be tricky. Using Shapley values, one explain the outputs and visualise the “whys” for any ML model

* Python package with description and example notebooks https://github.com/slundberg/shap
* Good explanation of how Shapley values work https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html#the-shapley-value-in-detail

## Useful material

* Introductory Scikit-learn material on regression/classification problems, visualising outputs, and cross validation - from a PyData Meetup in Cardiff. https://github.com/pydatacardiff/pydata\_cardiff\_workshop2 . If you scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on ‘launch binder’ then it opens an interactive Jupyter notebook in your browser which allows you to work through the examples.
* Lots of little snippets of useful code, good for beginners, by Chris Albon:    https://chrisalbon.com/


## Actual work related stuff

*  Linking ambulance records to A&E records. https://ijpds.org/article/view/1104
   The authors looked at the feasibility of conducting deterministic matching from ambulance records to A&E records without the use of patient identifiers. They only took one Trust in London, but the results look very promising. With ambulance records being notoriously difficult to link to because of no or limited patient details (difficult to collect data if the patient is unconscious), this is a potentially useful study. For us, it shows the importance of looking at combinations of data even if we don’t have what we want.

## Not-that-much work related stuff

* Generating new Pokemon using StyleGAN.

## Blogs

* Worried about facial recognition? If not, you should be: https://theconversation.com/facial-recognition-ten-reasons-you-should-be-worried-about-the-technology-122137


## Comics

* Want to find out what the hell is “federated machine learning”? Want to read comics? Want BOTH at the same time??
