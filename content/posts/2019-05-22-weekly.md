It’s that time of the week again. Here are the things I’ve read which I
thought were interesting and a few code repositories I think you might want to
keep an eye on.


## Blogs and reports

* [Do you know the ‘why’ behind what you
  do?](https://hbr.org/2019/05/do-your-data-scientists-know-the-why-behind-their-work):
  Harvard Business Review post talking about what skills tend to be lacking but
  are very important in the success of data science projects
* [Tensor incidence
  matrices](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-as-tensor-network-diagrams):
  Matrix applications in graph theory, but for tensors
* [Julia ML
  framework](https://medium.com/syncedreview/alan-turing-institute-releases-ml-framework-written-in-julia-ac649f7c1f04):
  The Alan Turing Institute have been hard at work making all of the ML bits and
  pieces they need available in Julia. Some of these are calls to python and R
  programs but that’s a good thing about Julia (it’s a great language!)
* [Customising ggplot2
  graphics](https://davidsmale.netlify.com/portfolio/customising-ggplot2-graphics/):
  This one makes my list purely because it rates dragonball. Turn your ggplot
  graphics from their basic form into SSJ2.
* [The R Taskforce](https://rtask.thinkr.fr/): Some French R users have created
  a task team, over time this website should become really useful for R fans.
* [Thoughtful
  impressions](https://avantlive.wordpress.com/2019/04/29/fathoming-the-deep-in-deep-learning-a-practical-approach/):
  Fathoming the ‘deep’ in deep learning. Warning: this uses introductory level
  calculus to explain it, if you don’t know what an integral is be prepared to
  take more time in getting through it.
* [Linux for data
  scientists](https://www.8451.com/blog/linux-for-data-scientists-part-1): This
  is the first part of hopefully many which can tell you what useful tools you
  have at your disposal without needing to fire up a programming interface.
* [What nobody tells you about
  documentation](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/): This one has lots
  of great info for helping you to understand what ‘documentation’ means. It’s
  not as simple as you think but if you can think of it starting from this
  4-partition approach and make it work for you the use and quality of your docs
  will go up!
* [Railyard’s model
  training](https://stripe.com/gb/blog/railyard-training-models): How kubernetes
  can help you to train models quickly. This is useful now because (1) the
  office have this available (2) you can integrate it into your gitlab workflow.
* [The empty promise of data
  moats](https://a16z.com/2019/05/09/data-network-effects-moats/): Trying not to
  be cynical I think we, as an office, have been guilty of treating data as a
  magical moat and not focusing on what gives us an actual win. This is a really
  good walk through of how to be better about that.
* [EdgeDB](https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/): A new contender
  for SQL’s throne, I think it’s actually some pretty neat tech and the
  improvements they talk about are ones which would improve my SQL life.
* [Going critical](https://meltingasphalt.com/interactive/going-critical/):
  Diffusion + networks, for anybody who is interested in epidemiology models


## Repositories

* [Interpret machine learning programs](https://github.com/microsoft/interpret)
  with Microsoft’s latest project
* Awesome lists are probably something you are familiar with,
  [here’s](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/awesome-decision-tree-papers)
  one for Huw for decision tree papers!
* [Machine learning
  mindset](https://github.com/machinelearningmindset/machine-learning-course): A
  machine learning course in python. It seems pretty snazzy but I haven’t looked
  at it in very much detail. Could be a useful resource for some.
* [Reversible reproducible documents](https://github.com/noamross/redoc): 2-way
  Rmd <-> word workflow


## Papers

* [CocoGan](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00284): Generating images in a more human
  way.
