Another quiet week. The task of being two people at once is making it much
harder to find time to read things which I find interesting. Highlights this
week include:

- Haskell propaganda
- Generic Data Science blogs
- Technical blog posts
- arXiv's best bits
- A __free__ book


## int main () { return 0; };

#### Haskell propaganda

The subject dearest to me: why is haskell better than everything else?

* **Haskell for [machine
  learning](https://serokell.io/blog/dimensions-and-haskell-introduction)**
  For a language which has seen so much academic use it is surprisingly
  currently lacking on the data science front. There is a really good
  [movement](https://datahaskell.org) to get it done.
* Speaking of dependent types, here is a [practical
 implementation](https://blog.jle.im/entry/practical-dependent-types-in-haskell-1.html)
 for NNs.
* [This](https://www.javiercasas.com/articles/codata-in-action) is
  probably the least obfuscated explanation of codata I've seen to date. Its
  pretty cool and now a lot more meaningful to me.


#### Generic Data Science

* Stuck in Jira backlog hell? Take a look over
  [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-scientists-are-thinkers-a36cc186d570)
  and hopefully it can remind you of what your job actually is.
* A [generalised expectation
  list](https://towardsdatascience.com/becoming-a-level-3-0-data-scientist-52641ff73cb3)
  for grades of data scientist, I don't really hate this one and that's about as
  positive as it gets from me on posts of this type.
* If you are thinking of moving into the private sector perhaps brush up with
  [this
  list](https://www.conordewey.com/posts/2019/5/17/10-reads-for-data-scientists-getting-started-with-business-models).
* [Here be
  dragons](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613578/ai-algorithms-liability-human-blame/).
  Another consideration of liability and ethics.
* Get yourself [up to
  speed](https://medium.com/huggingface/the-best-and-most-current-of-modern-natural-language-processing-5055f409a1d1)
  with the state of NLP in 2019.
* Some really [nice
  visualisations](https://medium.com/multiple-views-visualization-research-explained/data-is-personal-what-we-learned-from-42-interviews-in-rural-america-93539f25836d)
  and a review of public perception of the different types.


####  Technical blogs

* The netflix [monolith](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/building-and-scaling-data-lineage-at-netflix-to-improve-data-infrastructure-reliability-and-1a52526a7977) rolls on.
* airbnb [data
  management](https://buttondown.email/oneshotlearning/archive/one-shot-learning-4-large-scale-data-driven/)
* [Machine learning is coming](https://towardsdatascience.com/game-of-thrones-twitter-sentiment-with-keras-apache-beam-bigquery-and-pubsub-382a770f6583)
* Building a chatbot using [transformers](https://medium.com/tensorflow/a-transformer-chatbot-tutorial-with-tensorflow-2-0-88bf59e66fe2) (not the Hasbro kind)


#### arXiv's best bits

* [From scratch language GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09922)
* [Multisample dropout being the bomb](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09788)

#### Free book

Just in case you don't already have enough things to read owing to my emails,
have [a free book on automated machine learning](https://www.automl.org/book/).
I'm still split on whether automated ML is a good thing or not. If you're very
much for it I'd gladly listen to your arguments for it.


## Origin of the title

This is a song from one of my favourite albums of all time. A long extinct
Mancunian band called Beecher had this on their second album.

I'll be taking requests for titles and content that you would all like to share
and working on tarting this up a bit more than the defaults. If you want
something you enjoy to feature as a title or content then let me
know by [raising an issue](https://github.com/karetsu/diaries/issues).

I can currently include anthing from the following list:

- youtube
- vimeo
- speaker deck
- github gists
- giphy
- slideshare


## Twitter feed of the week

I don't imagine that this will be a regular occurrence because I am really not
particularly good at interacting with social media. But its worth checking out
and following Randy Olson.
