Blessings to you and your beloved dead, on this night when the veil is thin and
there is magick in the air.


Samhain is upon us and my week has mostly been taken up with preparing for
festivities with Fishman Jr so this week we have only a short selection of
content.


## Post of the week

I find myself very often stressing that machine learning and AI are not a magic
wand. I'm really quite happy that I've never had to explain this to any military
body. MIT's Technology Review (which I have previously linked to many times)
have posted an interesting discourse about [how easy it is to trick military
implementations](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614497/military-artificial-intelligence-can-be-easily-and-dangerously-fooled/).
If you never read the OpenAI post about their attempt at teaching machines to
play DotA better than people then it is worth seeing [their description of
Five](https://openai.com/five/) first!


## Blogs and commentary

- Google are [attempting to teach machines what something should smell
  like](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/10/learning-to-smell-using-deep-learning.html)
  based on molecular structure of the odour.
- Netflix have released and open-sourced their [polyglot
  notebook](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/open-sourcing-polynote-an-ide-inspired-polyglot-notebook-7f929d3f447).
  Think of this like a jupyter notebook in which each and every cell can be in a
  different language. They also offer a lot more IDE features than jupyter if
  you feel more comfortable in a fully fledged coding environment. I, however,
  will never leave emacs.



## Haskell propaganda

I am unabashedly pro-Haskell. If you want to learn a bit more about it to try to
make your own mind up then please take a look at:

* [Top software written in
  Haskell](https://serokell.io/blog/top-software-written-in-haskell)
* To become a little better at something it is useful to look at other people's
  implementations. [These
  repositories](https://serokell.io/blog/best-haskell-open-source-projects) are
  a great source of inspiration for problem solving
* Beginners [resources for learning
  more](https://github.com/albohlabs/awesome-haskell/)



## Origin of the title

This is the first line of the first stanza from Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven. Go
