A quiet week for me so a very short post for now until we get this week's guest newsletter from @mamonu.


## Upcoming events

- [Maintaining privacy](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/the-data-scientists-guide-to-preserving-privacy/register) as a data scientist


## Understanding data

- Using data of the correct resolution to [answer your questions](https://simplystatistics.org/2019/05/29/research-quality-data-and-research-quality-databases/)
- [Principles](https://retina.ai/blog/dataops-principles/) of dataOps


## Tech blogs
- [Generalised Additive Models](https://noamross.github.io/gams-in-r-course/) using R, what could go wrong when it sounds so much like GAN?
- The [Sleeping Beauty](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-sleeping-beauty-problem-a-data-scientists-perspective-56223b5128e4) problem in Data Science castle, a fun thought experiment


## Tools of the trade
- [Panel](https://medium.com/@philipp.jfr/panel-announcement-2107c2b15f52) builds dashboards for applications using the PyData ecosystem, sadly I got most of the way through it before I walked off and my free reading for the month ended, stupid medium.


## Unrelated but pretty cool

## Repos

- [parallelisation in python, but painlessly (dask but simpler)](https://github.com/ray-project/ray)


## Spending spree

* **Stitch**: Acquired by Talend
* **Alooma**: Acquired by Google
* **Periscope**: Acquired by Sisense
* **Looker**: Acquired by Google
* **Tableau**: Acquired by Salesforce

Billions of dollars of business transactions (the Tableau deal was just over $15bn on its own) in under a month in total.

## Origin of the Title

This week I have taken the name from a film I have recently rewatched. Find it on [rotten tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/5_centimeters_per_second).
