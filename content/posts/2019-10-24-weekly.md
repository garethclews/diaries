## Post of the week

As time goes on and I post more and more of these there are papers, blogs and
discussions which I feel will get lost in the backlog. I'm introducing a new
'feature' this week and this is where I give you my opinion on "if you read one
thing from this newsletter, make it this".

The very first of these is a combination of a [paper and an associated
blogpost](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/modeling-sequences-with-quantum-states)
from math3ma are my pick. Combining a few of the previous blog posts this
provides a mathematically robust way of modelling sequences using quantum
states. Spoilers: this allows you to build a generative model with little more
than some linear algebra! I will definitely be playing around with this in my
spare time and really like the idea, hopefully you will too.


## Blogs and commentary

- Most of us will be too young to remember the first AI winter, but if you want
  a brief history of how AI came into prominence and then faded from the
  spotlight **twice** then [Forbes has got your
  back](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/10/20/are-we-heading-for-another-ai-winter-soon/).
  There's also a little discourse about whether this time its around to stay.
- The World Wildlife Fund are working with Intel to [apply AI to monitoring and
  protecting Siberian tigers in northeastern
  China](https://medium.com/syncedreview/ai-in-wildlife-conservation-39f90782e959).
- Those who know me may well tell you I occasionally show some [grey
  hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_hat) tendencies. Whilst I don't
  consider myself a computer security expert of any kind (which I guess is
  telling about my enjoyment of hacking) I thoroughly enjoyed reading about an
  [application of AI for wifi
  hacking](https://www.evilsocket.net/2019/10/19/Weaponizing-and-Gamifying-AI-for-WiFi-Hacking-Presenting-Pwnagotchi-1-0-0/).
  I'm not about to go out and buy a Pwnagotchi but the idea is a nice one.
- A video covering [correlation vs
  causation](https://bigthink.com/videos/correlation-vs-causation) with some
  good examples.
- AI is having itself a [rosetta stone
  moment](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2220438-deepmind-ai-beats-humans-at-deciphering-damaged-ancient-greek-tablets/)
  as a collaborative tool in translating ancient Greek tablets.
- With all the noise about AI revolutionising healthcare its nice to see a
  balanced consideration of [what needs to happen for adopting it in this
  area](https://hbr.org/2019/10/adopting-ai-in-health-care-will-be-slow-and-difficult).
  Well done Harvard Business Review.
- One of my favourite people, Art Eidukas has written about [his adventures in
  functionland](https://finnkauski.com/opinions/adventures-in-functionland.html).


## Tools of the trade

- Microsoft have provided [a pile of
  documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/ComputerVision) around Computer
  Vision. The repo contains examples as jupyter notebooks and (tellingly?) uses
  Facebook's PyTorch ahead of Google's TensorFlow/Keras. This [is a growing
  trend](https://thegradient.pub/state-of-ml-frameworks-2019-pytorch-dominates-research-tensorflow-dominates-industry/)
  with over half of all papers now featuring PyTorch implementations. This
  should probably come as no surprise given how [featureful PyTorch has
  become](https://towardsdatascience.com/facebook-has-been-quietly-open-sourcing-some-amazing-deep-learning-capabilities-for-pytorch-a7ed5bc71f26).
- A fun addition for high performance fans, a [computational
  chemistry](https://github.com/nwchemgit/nwchem) framework makes my list
  because, in 2019, high performance computing is still being written in
  Fortran
- I'm sure my lack of interest in jupyter notebooks as a tool is well known by
  now, but for those of you who do like them your mapping life may be easier if
  you use [the bridge between leaflet.js and
  ipython](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet).
- Shiny is the closest thing I have ever encountered to a true artificial
  intelligence. No matter what you ask it to do it will always do what it wants
  and rarely the same thing twice! However, for the Shiny fans amongst you here
  is an [awesome list](https://github.com/nanxstats/awesome-shiny-extensions).
- As probably the least fashion forward person in the office [this image
  segmentation removing clothing from a
  picture](https://github.com/anish9/Fashion-AI-segmentation) is only a passing
  interesting application
- [Addressing failure prediction by learning model
  confidence](https://github.com/valeoai/ConfidNet). [It does exactly what it
  says on the
  tin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Does_exactly_what_it_says_on_the_tin).
- Paul Graham (founder of Y-Combinator) is known to be a fan of LISP, previously
  writing a dialect called
  [Arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_(programming_language)). He has now
  come to the table with a new LISP dialect. Go see more about it on [his
  website](http://paulgraham.com/bel.html)
- Facebook's Hack language has been extended with a [probabilistic
  programming](https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/10/18/hackppl/) dialect.


## Contributed reads

Two posts this week contributed by other members (this means I have not
necessarily read these).

- Following a recent promotion into a DevOps post for the Data Science Campus,
  Art has sent on [the 2019 accelerate state of
  DevOps](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/the-2019-accelerate-state-of-devops-elite-performance-productivity-and-scaling)
- Huw has thrown an article at us. It is a post about [what things should be in
  place before you even consider using
  ML](https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007).


## Origin of the title

[The Night of the Hunter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048424) must go down as
one of my favourite films of all time. Robert Mitchum is phenomenal and probably
the most menacing antagonist ever written.
