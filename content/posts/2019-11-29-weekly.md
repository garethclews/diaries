Who's more foolish? The fool or the fool who follows him?

## Post of the week

I'm sure it is no surprise that I'm a lover of horror. Literature, films and a
whole bunch of other things. So, what happens if we let GPT-2 generate lots of
horror stories given a little pre-warmup from us? Well [this
post](https://theoutline.com/post/8302/ai-incredible-horror-stories?zd=3&zi=hes4n2bb)
does exactly that. Whilst the content of the output is generally trash
(even the recipe) I do love that it gets pretty dark, pretty quick!

## Blogs and commentary

- Ever wanted to make a voiceover but don't like how you sound? Now, you can
  [sound just like Joe
  Rogan](https://futurism.com/the-byte/deepfake-ai-look-sound-joe-rogan)
  instead.
- Artificial Life is a new topic to me, but the folks over at The
  Gradient have a [good write
  up](https://thegradient.pub/an-introduction-to-artificial-life-for-people-who-like-ai/).
- El Reg are back and [promoting a book I
  want](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/26/you_look_like_a_thing_and_i_love_you_review/).
  It all links back into the machine learning fatigue I am getting from trying
  to explain the limitations of what is possible to those who think its wizardry
  (a blog post coming on something similar to this soon).
- The last bastion of hope in the world of Go [has finally been beaten by
  DeepMind](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20985260/ai-go-alphago-lee-se-dol-retired-deepmind-defeat).
  Turns out computers (note, a huge supercomputer) are good at keeping track of all of the possible trees of
  moves and follow on moves to allow them to win within a very strict set of
  rules. Who knew?
- I'm not very good with social media, so if you want to find some good people
  in the field to follow then you cannot go wrong with [sifted.eu's
  recommendations](https://sifted.eu/articles/30-ai-people-in-europe-to-follow-on-twitter/).
- If ever there was a clickbait title its ["Diversity in AI is not your problem,
  it's hers"](https://medium.com/@robert.munro/bias-in-ai-3ea569f79d6a). As you
  can probably tell by the fact I'm including it here, the title isn't to be
  taken literally and the article describes how woefully inept our NLP models
  are by recognising "his" as a pronoun but think that "hers" is a noun.
- MIT Technology Review has a quick summary of what Facebook are up to with
  regards to its [treatment of video
  nasties](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614774/this-is-how-facebooks-ai-looks-for-bad-stuff/).
  Still the problem of understanding meaning and context of language eludes even
  some of the best language modellers.
- Over at Google the focus is a little more about explicability of the models
  with the 'launch' of [explainable
  AI](https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-ai-whitepapers/AI%20Explainability%20Whitepaper.pdf).
  I'm really sceptical of this because of the sheer complexity of the inner
  workings, but if it proves me wrong I will be the first one celebrating.
- Something very pertinent from Heartbeat, [deep learning has a size
  problem](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/deep-learning-has-a-size-problem-ea601304cd8).
  I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment of moving research away from state
  of the art accuracy toward state of the art _efficiency_. I'd still prefer
  that we didn't have experiments like MegatronLM using up the equivalent of a
  single American's annual energy consumption in the (circa) 9 days it took to
  train though. Although the idea of pruning weights does make me want to see if
  we can get chaos from it.
- [Vicki Boykis](https://twitter.com/vboykis) has a good
  [description](https://vicki.substack.com/p/were-still-in-the-steam-powered-days?utm_campaign=The%20Data%20Science%20Roundup&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)
  of how we really aren't much past the middle ages in terms of how we work with
  and apply ML models and outputs.
- In attempting to model the ways in which a human brain thinks and learns,
  Nature have good [overview of the developments in neuromorphic
  computing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1677-2). Warning: this
  is behind a paywall and you need your OpenAthens account.
- It seems that robots are really here to take our jobs. Cards Against Humanity
  has [built an AI to replace their
  writers](https://www.techspot.com/news/82977-cards-against-humanity-built-ai-replace-their-writers.html)
- The Gradient doubling up on this list with a description of [an epidemic of AI
  misinformation](https://thegradient.pub/an-epidemic-of-ai-misinformation/) and
  this time is complemented with a post from Forbes about how [thinking that AI
  is similar to human intelligence could be
  dangerous](https://www.forbes.com/sites/fernandezelizabeth/2019/11/30/ai-is-not-similar-to-human-intelligence-thinking-so-could-be-dangerous/)
  (note: it is about a joint paper from the Oxford Internet Institute and the Alan
  Turing Institute but this is a bit shorter).


## Papers

Only one this week, and I think it deserves the award for [best abstract
2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11423).



## Haskell propaganda

- Okay, not strictly Haskell propaganda given that you can read half of it
  without seeing anything about a computer, but Bogdan Penkovsky's writeup of
  [convolutional neural networks (with
  implementation)](http://penkovsky.com/neural-networks/day5/) is really good.
- I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. [Haskell + Blade Runner = tears in
  rain](https://dev.to/therewillbecode/modelling-the-world-of-blade-runner-with-haskell-s-type-system-41af).
- Wonder how to combine nix and Haskell? Enjoy [this
  cookbook](https://www.srid.ca/haskell-nix.html). I swear by a combination of
  nix and cabal for all my haskell needs so this is quite useful.
- Does this list of Haskell propaganda contain a link to a list of Haskell
  propaganda? [Yes, it
  does](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-11-24-design-and-testing-articles.html).


## Origin of the title
