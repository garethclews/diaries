## Blogs and commentary

* Do you find your logistic regression loss behaves? Perhaps it is a naive
  implementation and it wasn't quite crafted with the accuracy and love we'd
  hope for. I suggest reading [How to evaluate the Logistic Loss and not NaN
  trying](http://fa.bianp.net/blog/2019/evaluate_logistic/)

* Facebook's AI group were the source of two posts this week
  - the first has no hope of working for me because even with [fashion
    suggestions](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/building-ai-to-inform-peoples-fashion-choice/)
    I would look rough around the edges
  - The second is looking to make improvements to [AI game playing
    strategies](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-teaching-ai-to-plan-using-language-in-a-new-open-source-strategy-game/)
    which is typically done via [reinforcement
    learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kopoLzvh5jY)
* In the news was the terrifying reality (but not really any surprise) that you
  are already being discriminated against based on your appearance by machines
  as well as humans. Didn't get the job you wanted? Perhaps this is [the fault
  of AI](https://www.theregister.co.uk/AMP/2019/10/06/ai_roundup_041019/)
* I am a fan of Bayesian statistics. However, it hasn't been sexified into
  inclusion in the courses of data science. Even if hyperparameter optimisation
  is an application of Gaussian Process. Get your learning on with [fastml's
  intro to Bayesian machine learning](http://fastml.com/bayesian-machine-learning/)
* Wired ran an interview with Yoshua Bengio (who jointly won the Turing Award
  with Yann LeCun and Geoff Hinton this year) in which he gives his aims toward
  a [causal relationship in
  AI](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-pioneer-algorithms-understand-why/). This
  was also mentioned to me by Vahe completely independently so it comes with the
  Nafilyan seal of approval too!
* ETHZ (i.e. the 'tech school in Zurich') have launched a spin-off business in
  [prefabricated
  AI](https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2019/10/deep-learning-vorgefertigt.html).
  It may be worth keeping an eye on the customers of this should we ever need to
  write business cases for our own implementations.
* A complete rewrite of a complex system is always a daunting task, but [when
  should you attempt
  it](https://tech.channable.com/posts/2019-10-04-why-we-decided-to-go-for-the-big-rewrite.html)?
* Whilst not data science related, I found a post about [sexual harrassment in
  science](https://caltechletters.org/science/feynman-harassment-science) and
  the way in which those people put on a pedestal can propagate such heinous
  behaviour unsettling. As a mathematician in a previous life the way in which
  we treat others with the same interests and abilities to us appals me. If you
  are thinking 'so what?' then you aren't aware that there is already a history
  of sexual harrassment in data science. Both [Google
  AI](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/22/google-ai-researcher-sexual-harassment-female-data-scientists)
  and
  [DataCamp](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup)
  have behaved in such a way in the last few years. We need to work our hardest
  to ensure that it does not continue.


## Research papers

* [Automated text summarisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03186) is a really
  hot topic at the minute. The kicker is that here, their model gives a strong
  description of the content. Don't believe me? They used it to write the
  abstract!
* [Hamiltonian graph networks with ODE
  integrators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12790) where the authors introduce an
  approach for imposing physically informed inductive biases in learned
  simulation models. This paper is pretty maths heavy given that it is only 10
  pages from start to finish, but it is a good read.


## Propaganda

* [You are already smart enough to write
  haskell](https://www.williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-10-05-you-are-already-smart-enough.html)


## Origin of the title

Only [one of the greatest movies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107120/) of all
time. As it is nearly time for the greatest day of the year (that is Halloween,
not Christmas you heathens) I will be using more spoopy titles in weeks to come.
