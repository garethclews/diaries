After a brief hiatus we are back with a pretty short newsletter this week. Turns out that being
ill lowered my concentration and I couldn't get through as many things.


## Blogs

* What happens when we let algorithms be weird? For one, it gives us some great names for new breeds of [snake](https://aiweirdness.com/post/178980378702/new-neural-net-snakes)!
* How retailers are using BERT to give customers what they are really [looking for](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2019/07/15/give-me-jeans/).
* What if you allowed algorithms to write [ChipTunes](https://chrisdonahue.com/LakhNES/) for video games? Well LakhNess lets you play around with video game soundtracks of yore. This was a great dose of nostalgia when I was ill, may it bring you as much joy as it did me.


## Tools of the trade

* I really don't know how I would function without [emacs](https://medium.com/@aria_39488/the-niceties-of-evil-in-doom-emacs-cabb46a9446b) in my life. If you aren't using [doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) then maybe this post will get you to check it out.
* Stuck at the command prompt and terrified of reading enough manpages that you end up on [Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon)? Then try [http://cheat.sh](http://cheat.sh).
* I utterly despair of the world we are living in where there are cloud based GPU services offered to provide autocompletion for code. However, that is the world we are living in. If you want to make your GPU bleed just to offer you some ideas about what your next code stanza is going to be then check out [TabNine](https://tabnine.com/blog/deep).


## Papers

* [Bayesian inference on low dimensional subspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07504) is a good expansion of the use of Bayesian inference techniques to problems where a lot of the variance can be explained by surfaces of much lower dimension than the whole space. Turns out it can work pretty well for image classification and regression problems. My brain is sadly not working well enough to translate this into a direct machine learning problem to see which techniques it is equivalent to.


## Haskell propaganda

* Here's a [comparison](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-07-17-codestatistics.html) of the content of packages in python and haskell. Its actually not a bad one because it doesn't try to suggest that one is better than the other!


## Origin of the Title

This week is brought to you by [Buttercup cough syrup](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Buttercup-Cough-Mixture-Syrup-Original/dp/B001E1CVPG). Helping me to prevent my body from forcefully ejecting my lungs through my mouth.
