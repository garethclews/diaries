Hobbs & Shaw wasn't actually *that* bad...


## Post of the week

This week has been spent mostly reading mathematics (which I won't bore you
with) so my post of the week is the light summary of OpenAI releasing that [they
said was too
dangerous](https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2019/11/05/remember-that-scary-ai-text-generator-that-was-too-dangerous-to-release-its-out-now/).
As exciting as it is terrifying.


## Blogs and commentary

- Monzo have recently scaled up their data team from 1 to 30 people. [Here's how
  they did it](https://monzo.com/blog/2019/11/04/how-we-scaled-our-data-team-from-1-to-30-people-part-1).
- Ever wonder whether given housing information you could try to predict airbnb
  prices? Even if you didn't we have a [post for
  you](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-airbnb-prices-with-machine-learning-and-location-data-5c1e033d0a5a).
- As we have previously seen, it is hard to implement any form of AI to provide
  benefits in health. Springer's BSC [discusses the key challenges in delivering
  clinical impact](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-019-1426-2).
- I read a nice little paper (only 11 pages) providing a [language dataset for
  understanding humour](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06618.pdf).


## Tools of the trade

- Resampling (not a new topic) is gaining interest as a way to solve machine
  learning problems for e.g. estimation of variance. Lucky for us, there's a
  [free book](https://www.resample.com/intro-text-online/) on the topic to get
  us started. Especially if you are looking to start making use of bootstrapping
  to build an [understanding of causation in your
  problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09648).
- In a bid to become more productive with my time, I'm going to trial the use of
  the [pomodoro
  technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique). Whether or
  not this suits my style of getting things done I'm not sure yet, but it may
  work for you.
- For those looking for an introduction to the mechanics of deep learning, I
  recommend the [deep learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) book from MIT
    press.


## Origin of the title

It's a terrible film but I was reading the posts this week at some speed so
needed something to reflect that!
