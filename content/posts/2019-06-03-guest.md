Hi all,

Aloy asked someone else to do the reading list for 2 weeks and I volunteered for this week. So lets see what did I read/found interesting this week:


## Blogs and reports

* [ML with privacy at scale](https://machinelearning.apple.com/2017/12/06/learning-with-privacy-at-scale.html) from Apple
* [Understanding Fake Agile](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2019/05/23/understanding-fake-agile/#7b8d843e4bbe)

* [Detecting semantic similarity in pages on gov.uk](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2019/05/23/detecting-semantic-similarity-on-gov-uk/)


## Repositories

2 useful R packages for dealing with ungodly horrible excel sheets from hell. The author is a data scientist from GDS!

* https://github.com/nacnudus/unpivotr
* https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl

#### Testing frameworks

* [mutation testing plugin](https://github.com/sixty-north/cosmic-ray): works with pytest and unittest frameworks and is a really interesting way to test that your test suite has good coverage, because just because something is tested doesn’t mean it’s well tested!


#### Open Neural Network Exchange format

For enabling machine learning framework interoperability

- https://github.com/onnx/onnx
- https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime

and scikit-learn/tensorflow model to onnx tools:

- https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx
- https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorflow


#### Cron health checks

Get notified [when your cron jobs fail](https://github.com/healthchecks/healthchecks)

#### A docker container image builder for researchers

## Papers


* Online Event Processing: [Achieving consistency where distributed transactions have failed](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3321612)


Regards,
Theodore
