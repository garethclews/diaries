I'm back from leave. These are the things I found interesting in my week off.


## News roundup

* Is it tragic when a computer thinks it [has painted a
  Picasso](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614333/this-picasso-painting-had-never-been-seen-before-until-a-neural-network-painted-it/)?
* Facebook are working hard at not only tracking everything digital about you,
  they're also moving into the physical realm by using AI to improve the
  [tracking of your hand movements for VR
  headsets](ttps://ai.facebook.com/blog/hand-tracking-deep-neural-networks/)


## Blogs and research

* Got noisy data? Google's AI team think a [bi-tempered logistic loss
  function](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/bi-tempered-logistic-loss-for-training.html)
  is a good call for you!
* I'm a huge fan of horror films, including all of Boris Karloff's monsters.
  Turns out you can do some pretty neat things with [hierarchical clustering as a
  paintbrush for drawing images](https://fronkonstin.com/)
* If you think that postcode area, gender and date of birth is a suitable level
  of anonymisation you may want to [think
  again](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613996/youre-very-easy-to-track-down-even-when-your-data-has-been-anonymized/).
  This work is in part done at Imperial College London, who have set up a nifty
  [live app](https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/individual-risk/) where you can see just
  how unique you are within those three data points for you. FYI, Fishman can
  only be identified exactly from his three points of data 63% of the time.
  Guess this makes me a sardine?
* [What do we do when we collect too much
  data?](https://vicki.substack.com/p/logs-were-our-lifeblood-now-theyre) Given
  the demand for all of the data, right now (although we rarely get what we
  want) are we building a rod for our own backs?
* I've received a few recommendations for a presentation given by Susie Lu on
  visualisation and luckily for us there's a [blog
  post](https://www.susielu.com/data-viz/abstractions) about exactly that talk
* Want to learn some maths? Want it to not make your brain melt? Here's a good
  introduction to
  [adjunctions](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-an-adjunction-part-1) where
  you only want things to be 'pretty much' the same - parts
  [two](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-an-adjunction-part-2) and
  [three](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-an-adjunction-part-3) parts of
  this blog have also now been posted so you can go as deep as you want in your
  understanding of this useful mathematical concept


## Books and papers

* In a paper written by unknown authors there is an extension of an NLP context
  tree into the world of equations, allowing for applications of [deep learning
  for symbolic mathematics](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1eZYeHFDS)
* [Applications of Bayesian ensembles in NLP
  tasks](https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2018-bayesian-ensembles) is yet more
  work toward a scientific understanding of language


## Tools of the trade

* I became aware that people around me hadn't heard of or used [Kalman
  filters](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/media/pdf/kalman_intro.pdf) so I
  scoured the internet for the cutest [drawings to help others understand
  them](https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/) - I
  really wish I had this resource when I was teaching the topic to undergraduates
* A long time ago, because I'm pretty lame, I read
  [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) for
  'fun' - since then it seems that the "wizard book" is becoming ever more
  relevant for people outside of computer science
* Working in a purely functional language? Want an amazing way to reference
  pieces of data? [Build your own lenses](https://vitez.me/building-lenses) is a
  20 step program to teach you about these abstract but awesome things, and you
  don't even remotely need a PhD to understand it here!
* I was reminded of a good lecture from Dan Licata in 2012 about [domain
  specific
  datatypes](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/previous-semesters/2012-spring/resources/lectures/09.pdf),
  if the content eludes you then I think that's ok because the absolute most
  important part of this document is the opening gambit


## Origin of the title

A slight mistake on what WSfL meant... it should have been Windows Subsystem for
Linux.
