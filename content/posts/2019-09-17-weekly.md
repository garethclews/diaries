A very short one this week, not a lot of reading has been done at all (blame
[Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_(video_game))!).


## Commentary and blogs

Have you ever wondered if the people around you know how to cater to the needs
of nurturing and developing a data scientist? Well now you can throw a
[report](https://oreilly-ds-report.s3.amazonaws.com/Care_and_Feeding_of_Data_Scientists.pdf)
in their laps and ask them to read something which will help!

* [Monzo](https://monzo.com) are trying to use machine learning to help them
  operate. The biggest problem they face is that they need answers yesterday.
  [Here](https://nlathia.github.io/2019/08/13/Machine-learning-faster/) one of
  their employees discusses how they can develop and deliver on machine learning
  insights fast enough to be useful
* An ['AI first'](https://www.nathanbenaich.com/blog/ai-first-biology) approach
  to biology. I think this kind of thing may become more common amongst
  experimental scientists.


## News roundup

* The coverage of ML applications in mainstream media has steadily been growing.
  Wired have recently posted about [how brittle ML models
  are](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-can-pass-standardized-testsbut-it-would-fail-preschool/)
* Quantum searches (quantum algorithm for searching which can reduce the number
  of steps for the search) may actually be a [property of
  nature](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614259/an-important-quantum-algorithm-may-actually-be-a-property-of-nature/)
* In a related topic, we now also have the theory behind a [Quantum
  CNN](https://phys.org/news/2019-09-quantum-convolutional-neural-networks.amp)
* AI is still not _great_ at image classification. If we can improve it, then we
  may be able to have a real effect in [improving disaster
  response](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614246/ai-image-recognition-improves-disaster-response/)


## Research

* As ML applications become more widespread and are used to monitor people and
  their movements there is a large drive to develop countermeasures to make sure
  that we don't end up in 1984. This [deep
  privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04538) paper is a nice start to masking
  people's faces live.
* Have a need to formally verify your NLP model? Try [interval bound
  propogation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01492)


## Tools of the trade

Not really a technical tool this week. I was having a conversation with a friend
(IRL) who was trying their hardest to get their head around some extremely
complicated maths and were struggling to really understand it. They had never
heard of the [Feynman technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/) and
its worked wonders for them. I can imagine that it may be new to some of you as
well but it is a great way to make sure that you absolutely understand something.


## Origin of the title

You may have heard of this book, it is by Dr. Seuss and is the magnificent
[Green Eggs and
Ham](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Green-Eggs-Ham-Dr-Seuss/dp/0007355912). My
daughter loves listening to me trying to read it as fast as I can and flubbing
my way through the latter half!
