## Post of the Week

The Information Commisssioner's Office and The Alan Turing Institute are
teaming up to publish their first draft of [guidance into the use of
'AI'](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/blog-ico-and-the-alan-turing-institute-open-consultation-on-first-piece-of-ai-guidance/).
Given that [companies could be fined if they fail to explain decisions made by
AI](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2225186-companies-could-be-fined-if-they-fail-to-explain-decisions-made-by-ai/)
the repercussions of not following this guidance could be huge.

The joint consultation from these two bodies is a very important task to prevent
widespread mis-use (or at least be able to point people to a document to explain
how they are doing it wrong). I'll be keeping a close eye on the outcome of this
as the consultation closes on January 24th.

If you want to know more about the current state of explainability of modern
machine learning techniques then
[this](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-overview-of-model-explainability-in-modern-machine-learning-fc0f22c8c29a)
post from TowardsDataScience can help you out.


## Stupid idea corner

I have a lot of stupid ideas and, instead of writing them down and proving only
to myself what an idiot I am, I figured I may as well make it common knowledge.
I'll try to share one a month to force me to think of odd and (doubtfully)
interesting questions. This month:

Are any of our current language models compatible with Wittgenstein's concept of
'language games'? That is that the language in use only has meaning in its own
specific context and that put into another context it can mean something
different. If we are to move toward genuine understanding of context then this
seems the most obvious route to victory to me. I don't believe I have seen an
explicit gamed approach that attempts to assign meaning to words or sentences as
the result of the 'rules of the game' being played between the communicator and
the 'reader'.

If you are interested in Wittgenstein's thoughts on language (and they really
are very interesting) then you can do worse than reading [100 aphorisms with
commentary](http://users.rcn.com/rathbone/lwtocc.htm). The whole thing is far
more elaborate and complex than 2 rambling paragraphs could ever give credit to
and the rabbit hole leads into semiotics which can be fascinating in its own
right (and I have previously read on things such as chemotaxis and
morphogenesis which are tenuously linked to this).


## Blogs and commentary

- It is no secret that I play and watch a lot of video game content. There's a
  bit of a current trend in the media for using virtual avatars in their videos
  as a means of viewer interaction. E.g. Guilty Gear player Omito has Omimi-chan
  (オミミ―ちゃん) for the viewers.
  {{< figure src="../../images/2019-12-11-omimichan.jpg" title="Omimi-chan (オミミ―ちゃん)" >}}
  I'm not really a fan of these but I do like [an application of deep learning
  to be able to generate their movements and behaviours from a single
  video](https://medium.com/syncedreview/deep-learning-model-morphs-vtube-talking-heads-with-a-few-mouse-clicks-e973772f5f0e).
- When you first start to learn about language processing you will be told about
  The Federalist Papers (a very important set of documents in American political
  history) and be shown how those papers for whom the writers are not known [can
  be attributed based on the writing
  styles](https://blog.jonlu.ca/posts/the-federalist-papers-author-identification-through-k-means-clustering).
  Well this doesn't stop here, as now, Shakespeare's works have also been given
  [a similar
  treatment](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614742/machine-learning-has-revealed-exactly-how-much-of-a-shakespeare-play-was-written-by-someone/).
  This extends the idea by allowing even scenes in plays to be attributed to
  authors and supports a view that Henry VIII was a joint effort from
  Shakespeare and John Fletcher.
- I'm pretty excited to have seen a Simon Peyton-Jones (yeah, the internet guy)
  talking about [the new English National Curriculum of computer
  science](https://codesync.global/media/revolution-in-computing-education-at-school-opportunity-and-challenge-cmldn19/)
  from primary school and up. As a parent of a child going through primary
  school now I am hopeful that Wales won't be far behind.


## Papers

- Find your GANs are always diverging? Want to improve interaction between your
  ~~reaction~~ generator and ~~diffusion~~ discriminator? Enter
  [LOGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00953) - sadly there are no pictures of
  Wolverine.

> NOTE: reaction-diffusion systems were studied by Alan Turing who wrote a
> [seminal paper](http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf).
> If you have a mathematical background I highly recommend it. Even if just to
> read some Turing work that isn't computer related. I know that these systems
> are not the same as generator and discriminator but I like to think of them as
> similar.


## Tools of the trade

- I nearly ruined Christmas. In my first post of December I had completely
  neglected to post the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) website. This
  is a series of daily challenges where you can submit your solutions to
  problems and obtain stars if you are one of the fastest to solve the problem.
  Even if you aren't competitive the exercises are typically quite good for
  practicing approaching problems you've never seen before.
- Find yourself designing workflows you need to run at scale and deploy into
  production? I have never experienced that pain but if it sounds like you
  then Netflix have released their tool [Metaflow](https://metaflow.org/) (via Huw).
- I'm quite excited to be getting a copy of [Optics by
  Example](https://leanpub.com/optics-by-example) so I've been following on with
  Chris Penner's [Advent of
  Optics](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/advent-of-optics-04) and playing along.
- Not much Haskell propaganda this week so I'm including it here. A nice summary
  of [how Haskell can make your life
  easier](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-11-30-how-does-haskell-make-life-easier.html).
- Pimp your editor with Dayle Rees' colourschemes mk. II. They're now called
  [rainglow](https://rainglow.io/#gloom-contrast). I had been using Peacocks in
  Space for many years until [nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) came along.


## Origin of the title

It is almost the holidays so it is time for some festive titles. This time from the
best Christmas movie - Die Hard. Although I'm using the Brooklyn 99 version as
it is less sweary.
