## Post of the Week

The Information Commisssioner's Office and The Alan Turing Institute are
teaming up to publish their first draft of [guidance into the use of
'AI'](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/blog-ico-and-the-alan-turing-institute-open-consultation-on-first-piece-of-ai-guidance/).
Given that [companies could bve fined if they fail to explain decisions made by
AI](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2225186-companies-could-be-fined-if-they-fail-to-explain-decisions-made-by-ai/).

The joint consultation is a very important task to prevent widespread mis-use
(or at least be able to point people to a document to explain how they are doing
it wrong). I'll be keeping a close eye on the outcome of this as the
consultation closes on January 24th.


## Blogs and commentary

- It is no secret that I play and watch a lot of video game content. There's a
  bit of a current trend in this for using virtual avatars in their videos. E.g.
  Guilty Gear player Omito has Omimi-chan (オミミ―ちゃん) for the viewers.
  {{< figure src="../../images/2019-12-11-omimichan.jpg" title="Omimi-chan (オミミ―ちゃん)" >}}
  I'm not really a fan of these but I do like [an application of deep learning
  to be able to generate their movements and behaviours from a single
  video](https://medium.com/syncedreview/deep-learning-model-morphs-vtube-talking-heads-with-a-few-mouse-clicks-e973772f5f0e).

- I'm pretty excited to have seen a Simon Peyton-Jones (yeah, the internet guy)
  talking about [the new English National Curriculum of computer
  science](https://codesync.global/media/revolution-in-computing-education-at-school-opportunity-and-challenge-cmldn19/)
  from primary school and up. As a parent of a child going through primary
  school now I am hopeful that Wales won't be far behind.


## Tools of the trade

- I nearly ruined Christmas. In my first post of December I had completely
  neglected to post the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) website. This
  is a series of daily challenges where you can submit your solutions to
  problems and obtain stars if you are one of the fastest to solve the problem.
  Even if you aren't competitive the exercises are typically quite good for
  practicing approaching problems you've never seen before.
- Find yourself designing workflows you need to run at scale and deploy into
  production? I have never experienced that pain but if it sounds like you
  then Netflix have released their tool [Metaflow](https://metaflow.org/). Via Huw.
- I'm quite excited to be getting a copy of [Optics by
  Example](https://leanpub.com/optics-by-example) so I've been following on with
  Chris Penner's [Advent of
  Optics](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/advent-of-optics-04) and playing along.
- Not much Haskell propaganda this week so I'm including it here. A nice summary
  of [how Haskell can make your life
  easier](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-11-30-how-does-haskell-make-life-easier.html).
- Pimp your editor with Dayle Rees' colourschemes mk. II. They're now called
  [rainglow](https://rainglow.io/#gloom-contrast). I had been using Peacocks in
  Space for many years until [nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) came along.


## Origin of the title

It is almost Christmas so it is time for some festive titles. This time from the
best Christmas movie - Die Hard.
