A bumper crop after a week 'off' catching up on learning and life. We suffered a
bit of a setback and corruption has ruined the entire set of customisations of
the theme we are using and it was a git submodule that was never pushed.
I will have to ruminate on what to do about that. Until then we will be using a
simple theme. If you have any readability issues then hold fire on complaining
until I've rebuilt. I figure some content in the meantime is better than none.


## Post of the week

Machine learning is currently heralded as the great saviour of healthcare. What
happens though when the results come from flawed science? This is precisely what
has happened in the studies which have reported success in classifying expectant
mothers as likely to deliver pre-term. Instead of their 90% accuracy as claimed,
the results are [little better than 50-50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06296) when
treated properly.

How this is going to change as access to these programs gets easier but the
understanding also gets weaker is pretty scary!


## Blogs and commentary

- Mozilla give us a blog post entitled "[With Great Tech Comes Great
  Responsibility](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/great-tech-great-responsibility)".
  This guide is available to help students navigate ethical issues in the tech
  industry. It makes me feel like we are missing one for data science.
- Not so much an interesting read as it is some impactful news. OpenAI have gone
  [full PyTorch](https://openai.com/blog/openai-pytorch/). Chalk up another win for facebook!
- I've posted counter-surveillance links before now, but my favourite this year
  so far is Simon Weckert's "attack" on Google Maps. If nothing else this should
  show how easy it is to attack and manipulate large scale machine learning
  applications. If team red are this easy to fool then what hope is there for us
  mere mortals?
  {{< youtube k5eL_al_m7Q >}}
- [BlueDot](https://bluedot.global) scores another victory in [early prediction of
  coronavirus](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-epidemiologist-wuhan-public-health-warnings/).
  It didn't really help anybody though, WHO and CDC still rely on officials in
  the countries affected to base their announcements. Should BlueDot become a
  tool in the early prevention of such outbreaks or did it simply get lucky? We
  know how [flu trends can cause
  hysteria](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/0314policyforumff.pdf).
- I've found it really interesting how the scientific media has been picking up
  and discussing machine learning and 'AI'. Scientific American are currently one
  of the most vocal sources, giving us:
  + [AI isn't a solution to all our
    problems](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/ai-isnt-a-solution-to-all-our-problems/)
  + [I know some algorithms are biased - because I created one](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/i-know-some-algorithms-are-biased-because-i-created-one/)
  Some of this might initially feel like a knee-jerk reaction to those who feel
  that 'traditional science' is at risk (to be downplayed by ML practitioners as
  such) but we can't overlook the fact that these do contain some good points.
- Following on from the MoD contracts for £4M for defense, the UK government is
  looking for practitioners of '[general artificial
  intelligence](https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:600328-2019:TEXT:EN:HTML)'.
  I would assume that this doesn't mean that they want artificial general
  intelligence but more that they don't really know what they want and this
  **£90M** is to give recommendations on what is possible. Colour me skeptical as
  to whether we will really see the benefits, but temper that with just a small
  amount of hope that we do.
- I get a little bit upset when people try to programmatically solve what are A
  level mathematics problems so I sat head-in-hands when reading Vaselin Jungic's
  experience of [precisely
  this](https://theconversation.com/a-math-teachers-plea-lets-keep-pi-irrational-127159).
  I'm not against using computers to help understand the problem (I'm only about
  30% luddite), but it worries me no end when they are a replacement for
  thinking.
- Uh-oh spaghetti-ohs! IBM are [being
  sued](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/01/27/ibms_facial_recognition_software_gets_it_in_trouble_again/)
  because of their facial-recognition dataset essentially stealing photos from
  flickr. I think they're in the clear on this one because of the Creative
  Commons license that flickr uses in general, but with Illinois having a law
  which requires them to gain written consent from the individuals involved this
  is going to get a little prickly.
- Hackaday made me really happy when I saw that students were [hacking parking
  enforcers](https://hackaday.com/2020/01/24/students-use-low-tech-hacks-on-high-tech-parking-enforcer/)
  even going as far as piggy-backing on its network connection to get free internet!


## Propaganda

- I discovered an [applied functional
  programming](https://github.com/qfpl/applied-fp-course) course on github. Its
  pretty good and gives some good problems to tackle if you are learning an FP language.
- If you want to become proficient with Haskell in particular, then William Yaoh
  has some [recommendations for how to get
  there](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-01-11-road-to-proficient.html).
- I love open problems. If I were half the mathematician I should be then my
  spare time would be keeping up with attempts to win [Clay
  prizes](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/millennium-prize-problems).
  Now we have a [Haskell
  equivalent](http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/decade.html), but sadly without
  the prize pot!


## Tools of the trade

- I have recently discovered [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv). This
  wonderful little program lets me automatically activate nix-shells when I enter
  directories and lose them when I move out. It's especially awesome when coupled
  with [lorri](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-03-28-introducing-lorri.html).
- Not so useful in ML but I really enjoyed watching Piotr Jagielski using Clojure
  to 'live program' dance music. I'm not really the demographic for it but being
  able to programmatically implement and amend the song as its playing just
  reminds me of why I love emacs (yes, he's using IDEA but this is how I work on
  customising emacs) and lisps.

- Time to add yet another thing to your data vocabulary. Databricks have given us
  the term [data
  lakehouse](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/01/30/what-is-a-data-lakehouse.html).
  At least the buzzword bingo cards will be more interesting now!


## Origin of the title

Ahead of Netflix's rlease of Locke and Key I've been re-reading the series.
Keyhouse is an awesome place.
