Somehow I'm getting back up to speed with my usual reading rate (despite no more hours having been added to the day) and there's quite a bit here this week. It is quite a wide variety of things ranging from the seriousness of ethics and environmental impact through to building castles in Minecraft so hopefully there is something for everybody!


## Going back to thinking ethics, environment and my feelings toward the current state of machine learning

I never gave the non-release of GPT-2 particularly much thought at the time that openAI made the decision not to push out their full trained model with the research paper. I wanted to let the dust settle around it and to reassess how I feel about the thought of communication warfare (started, I guess with Cambridge Analytica's public dethroning) and how it sits with me. This is a really deep topic so instead of rambling on for what will be pages and pages I'll give you the same evidence I have been reading through to make up your own minds.

I'm optimistic for [project solid](https://solid.mit.edu/) but not yet convinced that it will gain enough traction to really give people the power back over their data. Just this week there has been a new release which can begin to counter the effects of deep fakes - read more about it in the [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614021/a-new-tool-uses-ai-to-spot-text-written-by-ai/). I believe there is also a new documentary on Netflix called The Great Hack but I'm yet to watch it.



As well as data ethics, many of you will have missed my discussion at the last DaSH show and tell. I spoke about environmental impact of machine learning with horror stories taken from genuine training tasks. If you missed it, you can still catch my slides [here](http://web.dsc.ons.gov.uk/dashSaT) but it won't include my explanations - if you want to read more then [this](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614005/ai-computing-cloud-computing-microchips/) is a good place to start. I'm going to do my best to try not to make this a platform for preaching and to keep it as politically neutral as possible, but they are both things that I am very interested in so they could crop up quite frequently.



For a more generalist discussion of the problems of automated thinking then there's a nice post in [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-hidden-costs-of-automated-thinking) which includes talk around the intellectual debt of machine learning.


## Weekly Haskell propaganda

* Haskell now has its own [phrasebook](https://typeclasses.com/phrasebook). Similar to Go by Example it is in a pretty early state right now but contains enough to help you get started in my favourite language
* [Generating castles in Mincraft using haskell](http://www.timphilipwilliams.com/posts/2019-07-25-minecraft.html) is a pretty fun way to spend a day and hopefully proof its not just for stuffy academic purposes!
* Right fold, the [superhero](https://hmemcpy.com/2019/07/right-fold-superpowers/), this one is helpful for understanding right fold across most languages and not just Haskell


## Blog, comment and opinion


Geoff Hinton and Yann Le Cunn (aka the OGs) talked about the deep learning revolution at their [Turing Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsnQf7exv5I) (the one they gave because they were awarded with the Turing prize - for which the third awardee Yoshua Bengio doesn't talk)


## Papers

Just one this week but it could turn out to be a pretty important one! Google's Brain team have just thrown out [a paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11279.pdf) on adding additional vectors into deep learning processes to give more understandable interpretations of what is going on in each layer. They consider a mapping from machine state to human interpretative state and directional derivatives can then provide a measure of sensitivity of understanding to that feature.


## Origin of the title

I watched this video and it was pretty cool so I played on their play of the name of Gauguin and the title is simply the name of one of his paintings, before he was able to work as a full time painter and sculptor.
