An airport nightmare in the US gave me plenty of time to read things. This is a
somewhat themed chronicle of my time in Orlando International Airport.


## Commentary and Blogs

Typically this section is just a monster list of bullet points. This week we
actually have some well defined themes to break this up into.


### Health

Ok, a little bit of a loose collection of things including psychology and
biology.

- An open challenge from Dr. Michael Joyner, if society really think that
  machines can be used for improving healthcare then [prove it by creating a
  weightloss plan for obese patients which
  works](https://www.statnews.com/2019/08/28/artificial-intelligence-medicine-turing-test-obesity/)
- Similarly, Forbes describe how machine power [cannot solve social and
  political
  problems](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2019/08/23/ai-and-healthcare-is-the-bloom-finally-off-the-rose/#68ae12e765fc)
  affecting healthcare.
- [Population genetics with
  AI](https://blog.floydhub.com/exploring-dna-with-deep-learning/). Even if you
  don't read this then think of that awesome Jurassic Park video with the genes
  of frogs.

- Not so much health related, but a nice
  [interview](https://medium.com/syncedreview/humans-dont-realize-how-biased-they-are-until-ai-reproduces-the-same-bias-says-unesco-ai-chair-9968bb1f5da8)
  with John Shawe-Taylor (you may not know the name but SVMs wouldn't be what
  they are now without his contributions) who is now the chair for artificial
  intelligence for UNESCO.


## Ethics

With my previous posts on environment and ethics you should not be surprised to
see a short section here with posts I have read around these types of topics. I
am not saying that I agree with every word they say but I did enjoy reading them
and hope that you can make your own decisions.

- [Podcast](https://www.eye-on.ai/podcast-020) on the environment
- The title sounds hilarious, but [this
  post](https://theconversation.com/singularity-how-governments-can-halt-the-rise-of-unfriendly-unstoppable-super-ai-121999)
  is really around the need for preventing AI from widening the monetary
  imbalances between large corporations (e.g. Google, Facebook) and the rest of
  whatever country they operate in
- Some fun in counter AI [surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/13/the-fashion-line-designed-to-trick-surveillance-cameras)


## News roundup

- In the least surprising news ever, Facebook had people listening in on
  [conversations](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/08/14/facebook_messenger_conversations/)
  to better train their models
- Mustafa Sulyeman placed on [administrative
  leave](https://insights.dice.com/2019/08/23/alphabet-deepmind-deep-trouble/)
  from DeepMind
- YouTube algorithms are [pretty
  crap](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/08/26/ai_roundup_230819/)


## Blogs and research

- Google's newest attempt at [voice
  transcription](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/joint-speech-recognition-and-speaker.html)
  but I'm not sure if
  [nVidia's](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/nvidia-breaks-records-in-training-and-inference-for-real-time-conversational-ai/)
  beats it for real time conversational AI but the use cases for it took a knock
  because Google's hate speech detection algorithms are [racially
  biased](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2213064-googles-hate-speech-detecting-ai-appears-to-be-racially-biased/)
- [Deep learning on biological
  phenotypes](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaaw4967)
- New ways to [synthesise nylon in an environmentally friendly
  way](https://phys.org/news/2019-08-ai-plot-green-route-nylon.html)
- ADAM finally gets
  [rectified](https://medium.com/@lessw/new-state-of-the-art-ai-optimizer-rectified-adam-radam-5d854730807b)
- Adding GAN selection to the AutoML family with
  [AutoGANs](https://medium.com/syncedreview/automl-gan-autogan-ai-can-now-design-better-gan-models-than-humans-3d862f8300c0)


## Books and papers

- Enjoy this free book on [mathematics for machine
  learning](https://mml-book.github.io). This is for those for whom Bishop's
  tome is a little too intimidating.
- Similarly, I found a paper giving a [selective overview of deep
  learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05526). This is almost a 'state of the
  art for deep learning' and will probably be out of date before the end of the
  year given the rate at which new tools and approaches are appearing!


## Tools of the trade

- I found a new shell, which is a [shell](https://xon.sh) (pronounce it the same
  as conch) - its actually a superset of python 3.5+ so you can do python things
  in a shell
- Spark and Kubernetes in the cloud with
  [prophecy.io](https://medium.com/prophecy-io/introducing-prophecy-io-cloud-native-data-engineering-1b9247596030)


## Haskell propaganda

- If you ever wanted to know more about the type system for lambda calculus then
  look [no further](https://morgenthum.tech/articles/write-haskell-game)
- [Transitioning from python to haskell](https://typeclasses.com/python) is a
  series of pages describing how some functional programming ideas are
  implemented in python and eventually how much better they are when working in
  haskell
- "You can't make games in FP because they are all about state", actually [Yes
  We
  Can!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_2008_presidential_campaign#Slogan)
  by looking
  [here](https://haskell-explained.gitlab.io/blog/posts/2019/08/27/pattern-synonyms/index.html)


## Origin of the title

I'm old. I'm back from holiday.
