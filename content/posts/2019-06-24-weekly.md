This week's newsletter has been brought to you by the letter 'mamonu' and the number 7.


## Blogposts/Articles

* [up and coming area or the dumps?](https://medium.com/@Sam_Floy/how-to-know-if-where-you-live-is-up-and-coming-fried-chicken-vs-coffee-shops-546080119f98) Interesting article with some fun data wrangling.
* [testing statistical software](https://www.alexpghayes.com/blog/testing-statistical-software/)  how to write and read tests for modeling software, with a focus on #rstats :package: packages. Really nice write up
* [Continuous integration of machine learning models with ease.ml/ci](https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/06/03/ease-ml-ci/) Since we dont only need to be testing our code but also our ML models
* [data validation for machine learning](https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/06/05/data-validation-for-machine-learning/) Since we dont only need to be testing our code and models but also the data
* [TensorFlow Text] (https://github.com/tensorflow/text)  Text processing in Tensorflow
* Towards Reproducible Research with [PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub) . Article talking about it [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/towards-reproducible-research-with-pytorch-hub/)

## Repos

* [tinytest](https://github.com/markvanderloo/tinytest) A lightweight, no-dependency, but full-featured package for unit testing in R
* [simputation](https://github.com/markvanderloo/simputation) Making imputation easy. Perhaps of interest


## Free ebook

Get a free ebook about Graph Algorithms in Spark [here](https://neo4j.com/graph-algorithms-book/). You can be naughty and give goobledygook details if you dont want to give your email


## Catch me if you GAN/GANfinger or perhaps The GANchurian Candidate?

*Note:* I was supposed to pick one of these but I like them all so they're staying.

## Tools of the trade

* ...[__et voila__](https://blog.jupyter.org/and-voil%C3%A0-f6a2c08a4a93 ), turn your jupyter notebooks into tools for non-technical audiences. The introduction to this really gives a lot of valid reasons why jupyter notebooks are not typically as good as others tout them to be. From Project Jupyter themselves no less! I'm not sold on this one if truth be told. It all feels a bit too `shiny` for my liking and I have never encountered anything even remotely as close to genuine computer cognition as shiny in R. It will take what you ask it to do and instead do what it wants, and rarely ever the same thing twice.
* Convert your data into text with [steganos](https://github.com/fastforwardlabs/steganos). Its things like this that can help to [protect your content](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyrics-site-genius-com-accuses-google-of-lifting-its-content-11560677400)
* [Learning Haskell in 2019](https://github.com/theindigamer/not-a-blog/blob/5ee43179fe4b148bd8c61680112b4e9e048481fc/opinionated-haskell-guide-2019.md) interested me because I was trying to think about how this blog would look like in other languages. For Julia its a book and there's no build tools, for R its all seemingly sewn up in RStudio these days (thanks Hadley) but python is the wild west with anybody with a gun claiming to be sheriff.
* Interested in learning about Lambda Calculus or have a child that you need to explain it to? Play the [alligator eggs](http://worrydream.com/AlligatorEggs/) game!
