Following the recent loss of all my hard work adapting the thematic side of the
website I have made the decision to call it a day with this blog. My final post
here will be on April 24th, marking the first anniversary of the diaries. I will
be doing my best to continue weekly posts until this date.

Following this, I will be taking down the rendered form of the site and you can
[pull from the repository](https://github.com/karetsu/diaries) to get the
archive. After this date it I will no longer maintain the repository, but I won't
delete it. I do not have the energy nor will to rebuild it - I really do not
enjoy web design or development (even if it is simply editing somebody else's
content).

I'd like to say thanks for sticking with us as long as you have and for all the
feedback I've received along the way. It made the slog of writing up the things I
have read and seen more bearable.


I guess I need to add an 'origin of the title'. This one is a quote from Robert Frost.
