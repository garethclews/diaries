A late one this week as I've been off with fishmanitis (inflammation of the fishman). Plenty of fun and interesting things included because of this time 'off' though!


## Fun times and discourse

* [Getting it wrong](https://news.sky.com/story/amp/met-polices-facial-recognition-tech-has-81-error-rate-independent-report-says-11755941), or, how Minority Report is still decades away unless you live in China
* [When word2vecs attack!](https://graceavery.com/word2vec-fish-music-bass/). We all know the King-Queen analogy for vector embeddings, now lets add some far more fun examples to our write ups!
* Help take your ggplot outputs [from 0 to publication in 30 seconds](https://cedricscherer.netlify.com/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/).
* [AI at the speed of light](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613668/ai-chips-uses-optical-semiconductor-machine-learning/)
* Moving on from books and movies, we now have twitch [streamer suggestions](https://towardsdatascience.com/streaming-recommender-twitch-e40d4a45e4ee)
* [Unix tools are still better than hadoop](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2019/06/04/using_awk_and_r_to_parse_25tb/) but is this any surprise? Hadoop is big and slow on purpose - should somebody be comparing this to a good spark version?
* Go read the [data as a service bible](https://blog.safegraph.com/data-as-a-service-bible-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-running-daas-companies-d4cf4c15c038) and then follow that up with [this post](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/data_dictionaries/).
* [GAMs in R](https://noamross.github.io/gams-in-r-course/). Note: this is not a typo, it really is GAM.
* [Overarchitecture is real](https://vicki.substack.com/p/you-dont-need-kafka) (to nobody's surprise)!
*  [Say hi to Facebank](https://stratechery.com/2019/facebook-libra-and-the-long-game/), an interesting post around Libra.



## Advances(?)

* When a transformer becomes your [pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237)...
* ...whilst even reinforcement learning is [getting in on the game](https://sites.google.com/view/hal-demo)
* [Creating new scripts/alphabets using GANs](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-new-scripts-with-stylegan-c16473a50fd0?sk=fec7c4e10e242df3ae41822c5b2d6440)
* [Graph representation at google](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/06/innovations-in-graph-representation.html)
* [Learning to augment data to find outliers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11172)
* [Predicting sets from feature vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06565)
* Okay, time to get out the tinfoil hats! They are probably the only things (well, a whole tinfoil suit probably) that can save you from [this](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613891/the-pentagon-has-a-laser-that-can-identify-people-from-a-distanceby-their-heartbeat/)


## The grindstone (aka 'tools and ideas we should use')

* A good [Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers](https://github.com/bentoayr/ADMM-tutorial) tutorial
* Have I mentioned that [I love Julia](https://github.com/JuliaStats/StatsModels.jl) and think its better than python now?
* If you are more programming than maths, perhaps this will help you understand [algorithmic differentiation](https://github.com/MikeInnes/diff-zoo)
* Programming things that I discovered and liked this week (blatantly just the latest additions to my github profile's starred repos list):
 - https://github.com/Wilfred/pyimport
 - https://github.com/brotzeit/rustic
 - https://github.com/intolerable/api-builder
 - https://mpickering.github.io/posts/2019-06-24-overkill-or-not.html
 - https://www.lumi.dev/blog/an-applicative-for-transactional-validation
* Yet [more](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/%7Eblynn/haskell/) [Haskell](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/typeholes/index.html) [propaganda](http://www.philipzucker.com/why-i-as-of-june-22-2019-think-haskell-is-the-best-general-purpose-language-as-of-june-22-2019/)


## Origin of the title

I have spent a huge amount of time this week listening to music. Most of that has been spent listening to Birds in Row, and this is the title of my album of the year from them for 2018.
