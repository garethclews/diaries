With no volunteers to take over these posts in my absence this will be the last
diary for the next 3 weeks or so. I'll try to fill it with enough things to read
whilst I'm not here!


## Commentary and blogs
- If you ever feel the need to use [40 trillion
  pixels](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/an-interactive-automated-3d.html) to
  have an algorithmically created image the brain of a fly, don't fret because
  Google have already done it!
- Catch up with the latest [trends in
  NLP](https://www.mihaileric.com/posts/nlp-trends-acl-2019/) from the
  Association for Computational Linguistics
- When you go on your next date, [be
  careful](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614031/ai-could-be-your-wingmaner-wingboton-your-next-first-date/)
  as its about to get a lot harder to know what is the person and what is their
  AI wingman
- The next big thing in ML is going to be applying existing knowledge to the
  [sound](http://blog.christianperone.com/2019/08/listening-to-the-neural-network-gradient-norms-during-training/)
  domain, NLP was so 2018
- A fun post in the [New York
  Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/science/math-equation-pemdas-bodmas.html)
  and the mathematical equivalent of that
  blue/gold dress problem of yesteryear.
- I have a new preferred way of explaining Monads to people (if you don't know
  what they are then perhaps avoid this particular rabbit hole for now!) who are
  getting started in understanding functional programming as it only depends on
  a little knowledge of javascript. Go
  [here](https://blog.kabir.sh/posts/inventing-monads.html) and get your
  learning on (*if you know a little js*)!
- I'm surprised I haven't shared this before but if you have more interest in
  computers than statistics [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) has a huge amount of
  posts on her website. These range from linux themed comic strips from her
  zines through to technical blogs on computing and then on to how to be happy
  when working in a remote job
- MIT wrote a good summary about how [policy innovation is promoting data
  sharing](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613927/trusted-data-and-the-future-of-information-sharing/)


## Courses and books
- Luke pointed me in the direction of a [Deep Learning Book
  Series](https://hadrienj.github.io/deep-learning-book-series-home/) and whilst
  I've only read the first eight posts the biggest selling point is that Yoshua
  Bengio is involved (you may have heard of him if you read last week's post as
  one of the winners of the Turing Award this year with Hinton and le Cunn).


## Papers

Only the one this week, but a pretty fun one. New research has been published on
['defuzzifying' an image](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02197). This is the tech
that has been part of TV crime shows for years - I lost count of how many times
the IT person has a blurry image and in seconds it processes to be a detailed
image of somebody's face.

There is also [this](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8744230) paper for
giving some privacy when facial recognition is being used but I've not found the
time to read it yet.


## Origin of the title

is Ron Swanson via deepfakes.
