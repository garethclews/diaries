A few really interesting articles and a couple of fun visuals this week. Stick around for the end, the last link is probably the most important!


## Graphics

* [A look at the design of Plotly Express](https://towardsdatascience.com/express-graphics-with-plotly-b48894d86964)
* Uncertainy and visualisation, parts [1](https://medium.com/multiple-views-visualization-research-explained/uncertainty-visualization-explained-67e7a73f031b) and [2](https://medium.com/multiple-views-visualization-research-explained/uncertainty-visualization-explained-part-2-continuous-encodings-967a7f7c38d0)
* [Data of the Humpback Whale](https://medium.com/@kcimc/data-of-the-humpback-whale-9ef09c5920cd)


## Applications of ML

* [Modelling lost demand](https://tech.instacart.com/modeling-the-unseen-6a51c9a02430)
* More of an application *for* ML but [zygote](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07951) and its [repo](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl) are pretty nice and make me even more fond of julia
* Interestingly (the article isn't that hot) a program replicating that one OpenAI refused to release has been made externally, and then [not released](https://medium.com/@NPCollapse/the-hacker-learns-to-trust-62f3c1490f51)
* How well do you think your neural net would perform if you gave everything the same weights and they were drawn at random? [Actually, much better than you'd expect](https://weightagnostic.github.io/)
* [Hamiltonian mechanics and neural nets](https://greydanus.github.io/2019/05/15/hamiltonian-nns/) gotta love some physics


## Programming discussions

* [Testing statistical software](https://www.alexpghayes.com/blog/testing-statistical-software/), many may scoff at the thought of having to write tests and doing continuous integration type tasks. It is all about making sure that the code is *correct*, surely this is important?
* [Making your programs more flexible by using plugins](https://youtu.be/98s9YfoXB68)
* [Empty and unit types](https://semantic.org/post/empty-and-unit-types/), genuinely far more interesting than their name suggests!
* [Why hadoop failed, and where do we go from here?](https://www.teradata.com/Blogs/Why-Hadoop-Failed-and-Where-We-Go-from-Here)
* [What happens if you put haskell in your sed](https://github.com/bawolk/hsp#readme)
* [Pure as the driven snow _or_ what to expect when you're expecting (pure programs)](https://www.cloudseal.io/blog/2019-06-07-pure-programs)
* Our very own @mamonu has started a blog series on testing, go [get reading](https://mamonu.github.io/Property-Based-Testing/)


## Real world things

* [Further talk](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/a-wave-of-acquisitions-in-business-intelligence-93ef319089d8) about all of those software purchases from last week
* [France bans analysis of litigation](https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2019/06/04/france-bans-judge-analytics-5-years-in-prison-for-rule-breakers/) punishable by 5 years in prison :o
 Not _quite_ as beefy as I just sold it, the ban is mostly around predictions arising from decisions made by specific judges. I can guarantee that people will still be doing this, I guess it just won't be automated...
* [CERN to de-Microsoft-ize!](https://home.cern/news/news/computing/malt-project)
* I've saved the most important for last. More so than I believe the ethics is right now (because the AI people talk about is a way away). [AI vs Captain Planet](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613630/training-a-single-ai-model-can-emit-as-much-carbon-as-five-cars-in-their-lifetimes/)


## Origin of the Title

Do I really need to do this?
