A quiet week on account of the [origin of the title](#origin-of-the-title). I
have read only 3 things.

* How [bias gets encoded in word
  embeddings](https://towardsdatascience.com/all-names-are-not-treated-equally-1e825ba34444)
  so that not all names score equally when applying for jobs.
* AI still doesn't have the [common
  sense](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615126/ai-common-sense-reads-human-language-ai2/)
  to understand human language.
* Why asking an AI to explain itself [can make things
  worse](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615110/why-asking-an-ai-to-explain-itself-can-make-things-worse/).




## Origin of the title

[GranBlue Fantasy Versus](https://versus.granbluefantasy.jp/?lang=en) came out

move is 'Magnificent Tool of Destruction'. Here it is in all its glory:
