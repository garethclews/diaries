## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this
code.


## What should I know before I get started?

This is an opinionated archive of posts I have read and found interesting (or
commentary on anything I have found wanting). The content does not represent
anybody other than the authors' own opinions.


### The website

The website is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and uses a modified official
theme. If you wish to submit improvements to the website appearance,
functionality etc. (and not the content) then please use the PR request form for
website changes. No additional web frameworks (e.g. node) will be accepted, the
website will remain mostly static with only a few javascript flourishes.


### The posts

There are two kinds of contribution. Articles for attention as candidates for
inclusion in the weekly posts and contributed articles. These are intended to be
viewed and written by those members of the data science community within the
UK's Office for National Statistics or other government institutes. However,
guest articles from those outside this sphere are still welcome but will tend to
appear on an invitation basis. If you find yourself outside of these spheres of
influence then please feel free to write your content up on e.g. medium and
submit it for considerations.


## How can I contribute?

Please raise an issue using the correct template for your request. Content, by
invitation or by other community members will be accepted in (ghf-)markdown
format by email. This is available when invitations are made or to business emails.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing
> that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original
> issue in the body of your new one.


#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

Check that the bug is not already open on
[hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues)'s issue list and is not a
known problem with the [theme](https://github.com/themefisher/meghna-hugo)
which we have made use of.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Issues should be usefully labelled with `good first
issue` and `beginner` tags. These are the best places to start.

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it
easy to use labels  for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're
interested in.

To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with search
links for finding open items with that label. We encourage you to read about
[other search filters](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) which
will help you write more focused queries.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that
every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than
one label from the same group.

Please open an issue if you have suggestions for new labels.
