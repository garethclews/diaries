<p>2020&rsquo;s content is finally coming through. Lots of fun and intereting things to
bring my brain slowly out of its slumber.</p>

<h2 id="post-of-the-week">Post of the week</h2>

<p>Not something I found interesting so much as terrifying. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/revolutionary-artificial-intelligence-warship-contracts-announced">Defense and
Security
Accelerator</a>
has announced contracts worth Â£4M to use &lsquo;artificial intelligence&rsquo; in warships.
Given how terrible AI is at playing war video games are we really pushing it into
machines which can define the fates of nations? Yes. Yes we are.</p>

<p>You should take this with a pinch of salt. I&rsquo;m conflating the reality of the
matter and I imagine the use is far more mundane. The thought of it is still
very skynet though!</p>

<p>MIT&rsquo;s deep learning series starts our year with a good description of what the
current state of the art in deep learning is and the hopes for 2020.</p>

<p>Towards Data Science have had a very, very busy start to the year.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/its-official-time-doesn-t-exist-8c786530eca1">Making use of time
features</a>,
in which you may learn a little physics.</li>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-in-brain-computer-interface-f650d00268d0">Deep learning in brain-computer
interface</a>
which is as futuristic as your favourite sci-fi novella.</li>
<li>A description of Uber&rsquo;s <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/uber-has-been-quietly-assembling-one-of-the-most-impressive-open-source-deep-learning-stacks-in-b645656ddddb">deep learning
stack</a>
and how it is one of the best.</li>
<li>Finally, a step back from the edge to provide a tutorial for <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/under-the-hood-of-deep-learning-e8bb39aec5d2">understanding
neural
networks</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other posts from around the web:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nature feature a description of how hardware can evolve to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00002-x">improve machine
learning capabilities of modern
computers</a>. The paper is
expensive to purchase so I haven&rsquo;t read it.</li>
<li>Microsoft made me happy (shocking I know) by pledging to become
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51133811">&lsquo;carbon negative&rsquo;</a> by 2050.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve previously posted blogs from Vicki Boykis so sticking with this tradition
we have <a href="https://vicki.substack.com/p/ai-wont-save-healthcare">AI won&rsquo;t save
healthcare</a>.
She has become one of my favourite voices in the machine learning world.</li>
<li>Tristan Handy (of data science roundup fame) has written a blog about the
<a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/analytics-engineering-for-everyone/?utm_campaign=The%20Data%20Science%20Roundup&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">changing landscape of
analytics</a>.
The central dysfunction of data section, in particular, felt very familiar to
me through a lot of conversations I&rsquo;ve had across government and industry.
Please use this full url as it refers via Tristan&rsquo;s newsletter.</li>
<li>DeepMind found a deep learning technique also works <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2230327-deepmind-found-an-ai-learning-technique-also-works-in-human-brains/">in human
brains</a>.</li>
<li>El Reg has their first <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/01/13/ai_roundup_100120/">AI
roundup</a> of 2020.
Including a link to a post on how machine learning is helping to drive <a href="https://www.bleedingcool.com/2020/01/11/warner-bros-outsourcing-decisions-to-greenlight-new-films-to-ai-doubles-down-on-worst-hollywood-instincts/">bad
decisions in
Hollywood</a>.</li>
<li>This one is worth a look if just for the gif at the top! Via boingboing, we
have <a href="https://boingboing.net/2020/01/11/optimizers-curse.html">when machine learning
cheats</a>.</li>
<li>Following up on a previous post describing how Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Henry VIII</em> was
probably about half written by John Fletcher is a discourse on how ML can
<a href="https://reaction.life/could-ai-revolutionise-how-we-read-shakespeare">change the way we read Shakespeare</a>.</li>

<li>Lenses are amazing. I&rsquo;ve talked about them previously but this week, here&rsquo;s
your chance to <a href="https://deontologician.com/wiki/lenses/">dig into the library</a>
a little bit.</li>
<li>Cabal is my favourite build tool. Well, when I couple it with nix it is
anyway. Go find out a little more about it and some of its
<a href="https://vrom911.github.io/blog/common-stanzas">features</a>.</li>
<li>Way back before Halloween I posted a <a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/foldl-adjunction.html">math3ma
blog</a> about adjunctions.
Junstin Le now brings more practicality to this idea by considering
<a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/foldl-adjunction.html">adjunctions in the wild</a> and
in particular looking at <code>foldl</code>.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve started an audit on the coursera <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/julia-programming">Julia Scientific
Programming</a> course. I&rsquo;ve
found the first week more elementary than I need but I&rsquo;m looking forward to
the rest. I&rsquo;m working through the videos without touching the notebooks and
writing my own .jl files and its definitely proving worth it. Give it a go if
you&rsquo;re interested in learning some Julia, its free after all!</li>
