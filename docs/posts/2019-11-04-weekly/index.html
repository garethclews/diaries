<p>Researchers have created an AI that draws what a person is looking at in
real-time by <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-draws-decodes-brainwaves">reading and decoding brain
waves</a>. There is an
associated paper with this on bioRxiv but I like this post more. This gets my
post of the week nomination because I did not expect it to be happening for
many, many years.</p>

<h2 id="blogs-and-commentary">Blogs and commentary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Google <em>et al.</em> spend a heck of a lot of time teaching computers to play
computer games. Now they have finally gotten one which smashes most people on
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1724-z.epdf">StarCraft II</a></li>
<li>The &lsquo;three-body problem&rsquo; is hard. However, given an initial state you can now
solve it using a neural net <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614597/a-neural-net-solves-the-three-body-problem-100-million-times-faster/">millions of times
faster</a>
than the traditional solver.</li>
<li>Facial recognition tech <a href="https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2019/10/facial-recognition-tech-struggles-to-identify-transgender-people/">struggles to identify transgender
people</a></li>

<h2 id="tools-of-the-trade">Tools of the trade</h2>

<ul>
<li>Following on from the post last time where I introduced Netflix&rsquo;s polyglot
notebooks, the post was a little light on how you use them on a day to day
basis. Don&rsquo;t worry though, TowardsDataScience has <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-jupyter-killer-polynote-dbe7106145f5">got your
back</a>.</li>
<li>In a similar vein, tweag.io talk about using nix (&lt;3) to make <a href="https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-02-28-jupyter-with.html">reproducible
notebook
environments</a>. All of
the talk around RAP is focussed on the reproducability but the truth of the
matter is that there is a tangle of low-level dependencies, which is different for
each language, and the notebooks have no idea how to set these up for you. If
you want to make something which is much simpler to pass around (albeit with a
dependency on being able to use nix) then this is for you.</li>
<li>Additionally, coding habits in these notebooks (note: I did not say
<em>standards</em>) of people who are not software engineers are terrible, myself
included. Go <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/coding-habits-data-scientists">improve your
habits</a>
and make the lives of others and your future self much easier.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="functional-programming-propaganda">Functional programming propaganda</h2>

<ul>
<li>Lenses are complicated and reading code making use of them probably has you
feeling like you fell into an alternate reality where somebody fell asleep on
their keyboard, predominantly with their face on <code>.</code>, <code>^</code> and <code>~</code>. However,
the practical applications of lenses are massive.

<li>If Haskell didn&rsquo;t curry its functions, <a href="https://medium.com/@cdsmithus/applicative-without-currying-f4c3bd9f1552">would we still care about applicative
functors</a>?</li>
<li>Interview coding tests are typically pretty fun exercises. Here&rsquo;s how you
might, functionally, <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2019/10/28/a-basic-haskell-solution-to-the-robot-journeys-coding-exercise/">go about solving a robot&rsquo;s journey
problem</a>.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re struggling to get to grips with making your code more like
mathematics, then James Sinclair has a good list of <a href="https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2019/what-i-wish-someone-had-explained-about-functional-programming/">things he wishes someone
had explained about functional
programming</a>.</li>

<p>Refused have a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/34OxtemPbAWuvw8RsSe9sx">new album
out</a>. Its really quite
good, and I like it a lot more now that I&rsquo;ve seen some of it live. This is the
opening line of the sample from the first track.</p>
