<h2 id="blogs-and-commentary">Blogs and commentary</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Do you find your logistic regression loss behaves? Perhaps it is a naive
implementation and it wasn&rsquo;t quite crafted with the accuracy and love we&rsquo;d
hope for. I suggest reading <a href="http://fa.bianp.net/blog/2019/evaluate_logistic/">How to evaluate the Logistic Loss and not NaN
trying</a></p></li>

<li><p>Facebook&rsquo;s AI group were the source of two posts this week</p>

<ul>
<li>the first has no hope of working for me because even with <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/building-ai-to-inform-peoples-fashion-choice/">fashion
suggestions</a>
I would look rough around the edges</li>
<li>The second is looking to make improvements to <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-teaching-ai-to-plan-using-language-in-a-new-open-source-strategy-game/">AI game playing
strategies</a>
which is typically done via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kopoLzvh5jY">reinforcement
learning</a></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>In the news was the terrifying reality (but not really any surprise) that you
are already being discriminated against based on your appearance by machines
as well as humans. Didn&rsquo;t get the job you wanted? Perhaps this is <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/AMP/2019/10/06/ai_roundup_041019/">the fault
of AI</a></p></li>

<li><p>I am a fan of Bayesian statistics. However, it hasn&rsquo;t been sexified into
inclusion in the courses of data science. Even if hyperparameter optimisation
is an application of Gaussian Process. Get your learning on with <a href="http://fastml.com/bayesian-machine-learning/">fastml&rsquo;s
intro to Bayesian machine learning</a></p></li>

<li><p>Wired ran an interview with Yoshua Bengio (who jointly won the Turing Award
with Yann LeCun and Geoff Hinton this year) in which he gives his aims toward
a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-pioneer-algorithms-understand-why/">causal relationship in
AI</a>. This
was also mentioned to me by Vahe completely independently so it comes with the
Nafilyan seal of approval too!</p></li>

<li><p>ETHZ (i.e. the &lsquo;tech school in Zurich&rsquo;) have launched a spin-off business in
<a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2019/10/deep-learning-vorgefertigt.html">prefabricated
AI</a>.
It may be worth keeping an eye on the customers of this should we ever need to
write business cases for our own implementations.</p></li>

<li><p>A complete rewrite of a complex system is always a daunting task, but <a href="https://tech.channable.com/posts/2019-10-04-why-we-decided-to-go-for-the-big-rewrite.html">when
should you attempt
it</a>?</p></li>

<li><p>Whilst not data science related, I found a post about <a href="https://caltechletters.org/science/feynman-harassment-science">sexual harrassment in
science</a> and
the way in which those people put on a pedestal can propagate such heinous
behaviour unsettling. As a mathematician in a previous life the way in which
we treat others with the same interests and abilities to us appals me. If you
are thinking &lsquo;so what?&rsquo; then you aren&rsquo;t aware that there is already a history
of sexual harrassment in data science. Both <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/22/google-ai-researcher-sexual-harassment-female-data-scientists">Google
AI</a>
and
<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup">DataCamp</a>
have behaved in such a way in the last few years. We need to work our hardest
to ensure that it does not continue.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research-papers">Research papers</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03186">Automated text summarisation</a> is a really
hot topic at the minute. The kicker is that here, their model gives a strong
description of the content. Don&rsquo;t believe me? They used it to write the
abstract!</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12790">Hamiltonian graph networks with ODE
integrators</a> where the authors introduce an
approach for imposing physically informed inductive biases in learned
simulation models. This paper is pretty maths heavy given that it is only 10
pages from start to finish, but it is a good read.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="propaganda">Propaganda</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.williamyaoh.com/posts/2019-10-05-you-are-already-smart-enough.html">You are already smart enough to write
haskell</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="origin-of-the-title">Origin of the title</h2>

<p>Only <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107120/">one of the greatest movies</a> of all
time. As it is nearly time for the greatest day of the year (that is Halloween,
not Christmas you heathens) I will be using more spoopy titles in weeks to come.</p>
