<p>Hobbs &amp; Shaw wasn&rsquo;t actually <em>that</em> bad&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="post-of-the-week">Post of the week</h2>

<p>This week has been spent mostly reading mathematics (which I won&rsquo;t bore you
with) so my post of the week is the light summary of OpenAI releasing that <a href="https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2019/11/05/remember-that-scary-ai-text-generator-that-was-too-dangerous-to-release-its-out-now/">they
said was too
dangerous</a>.
As exciting as it is terrifying.</p>

<ul>
<li>Monzo have recently scaled up their data team from 1 to 30 people. <a href="https://monzo.com/blog/2019/11/04/how-we-scaled-our-data-team-from-1-to-30-people-part-1">Here&rsquo;s how
they did it</a>.</li>
<li>Ever wonder whether given housing information you could try to predict airbnb
prices? Even if you didn&rsquo;t we have a <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-airbnb-prices-with-machine-learning-and-location-data-5c1e033d0a5a">post for
you</a>.</li>
<li>As we have previously seen, it is hard to implement any form of AI to provide
benefits in health. Springer&rsquo;s BSC <a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-019-1426-2">discusses the key challenges in delivering
clinical impact</a>.</li>
<li>I read a nice little paper (only 11 pages) providing a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06618.pdf">language dataset for
understanding humour</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools-of-the-trade">Tools of the trade</h2>

<ul>
<li>Resampling (not a new topic) is gaining interest as a way to solve machine
learning problems for e.g. estimation of variance. Lucky for us, there&rsquo;s a
<a href="https://www.resample.com/intro-text-online/">free book</a> on the topic to get
us started. Especially if you are looking to start making use of bootstrapping
to build an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09648">understanding of causation in your
problems</a>.</li>
<li>In a bid to become more productive with my time, I&rsquo;m going to trial the use of
the <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique">pomodoro
technique</a>. Whether or
not this suits my style of getting things done I&rsquo;m not sure yet, but it may
work for you.</li>
<li>For those looking for an introduction to the mechanics of deep learning, I
recommend the <a href="http://www.deeplearningbook.org/">deep learning</a> book from MIT
press.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s a terrible film but I was reading the posts this week at some speed so
needed something to reflect that!</p>
