<h2 id="post-of-the-week">Post of the week</h2>

<p>As time goes on and I post more and more of these there are papers, blogs and
discussions which I feel will get lost in the backlog. I&rsquo;m introducing a new
&lsquo;feature&rsquo; this week and this is where I give you my opinion on &ldquo;if you read one
thing from this newsletter, make it this&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The very first of these is a combination of a <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/modeling-sequences-with-quantum-states">paper and an associated
blogpost</a>
from math3ma are my pick. Combining a few of the previous blog posts this
provides a mathematically robust way of modelling sequences using quantum
states. Spoilers: this allows you to build a generative model with little more
than some linear algebra! I will definitely be playing around with this in my
spare time and really like the idea, hopefully you will too.</p>

<h2 id="blogs-and-commentary">Blogs and commentary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Most of us will be too young to remember the first AI winter, but if you want
a brief history of how AI came into prominence and then faded from the
spotlight <strong>twice</strong> then <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/10/20/are-we-heading-for-another-ai-winter-soon/">Forbes has got your
back</a>.
There&rsquo;s also a little discourse about whether this time its around to stay.</li>
<li>The World Wildlife Fund are working with Intel to <a href="https://medium.com/syncedreview/ai-in-wildlife-conservation-39f90782e959">apply AI to monitoring and
protecting Siberian tigers in northeastern
China</a>.</li>
<li>Those who know me may well tell you I occasionally show some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_hat">grey
hat</a> tendencies. Whilst I don&rsquo;t
consider myself a computer security expert of any kind (which I guess is
telling about my enjoyment of hacking) I thoroughly enjoyed reading about an
<a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2019/10/19/Weaponizing-and-Gamifying-AI-for-WiFi-Hacking-Presenting-Pwnagotchi-1-0-0/">application of AI for wifi
hacking</a>.
I&rsquo;m not about to go out and buy a Pwnagotchi but the idea is a nice one.</li>
<li>A video covering <a href="https://bigthink.com/videos/correlation-vs-causation">correlation vs
causation</a> with some
good examples.</li>
<li>AI is having itself a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2220438-deepmind-ai-beats-humans-at-deciphering-damaged-ancient-greek-tablets/">rosetta stone
moment</a>
as a collaborative tool in translating ancient Greek tablets.</li>
<li>With all the noise about AI revolutionising healthcare its nice to see a
balanced consideration of <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/adopting-ai-in-health-care-will-be-slow-and-difficult">what needs to happen for adopting it in this
area</a>.
Well done Harvard Business Review.</li>
<li>One of my favourite people, Art Eidukas has written about <a href="https://finnkauski.com/opinions/adventures-in-functionland.html">his adventures in
functionland</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools-of-the-trade">Tools of the trade</h2>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft have provided <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ComputerVision">a pile of
documentation</a> around Computer
Vision. The repo contains examples as jupyter notebooks and (tellingly?) uses
Facebook&rsquo;s PyTorch ahead of Google&rsquo;s TensorFlow/Keras. This <a href="https://thegradient.pub/state-of-ml-frameworks-2019-pytorch-dominates-research-tensorflow-dominates-industry/">is a growing
trend</a>
with over half of all papers now featuring PyTorch implementations. This
should probably come as no surprise given how <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/facebook-has-been-quietly-open-sourcing-some-amazing-deep-learning-capabilities-for-pytorch-a7ed5bc71f26">featureful PyTorch has
become</a>.</li>
<li>A fun addition for high performance fans, a <a href="https://github.com/nwchemgit/nwchem">computational
chemistry</a> framework makes my list
because, in 2019, high performance computing is still being written in
Fortran</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m sure my lack of interest in jupyter notebooks as a tool is well known by
now, but for those of you who do like them your mapping life may be easier if
you use <a href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet">the bridge between leaflet.js and
ipython</a>.</li>
<li>Shiny is the closest thing I have ever encountered to a true artificial
intelligence. No matter what you ask it to do it will always do what it wants
and rarely the same thing twice! However, for the Shiny fans amongst you here
is an <a href="https://github.com/nanxstats/awesome-shiny-extensions">awesome list</a>.</li>
<li>As probably the least fashion forward person in the office <a href="https://github.com/anish9/Fashion-AI-segmentation">this image
segmentation removing clothing from a
picture</a> is only a passing
interesting application</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/valeoai/ConfidNet">Addressing failure prediction by learning model
confidence</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Does_exactly_what_it_says_on_the_tin">It does exactly what it
says on the
tin</a>.</li>
<li>Paul Graham (founder of Y-Combinator) is known to be a fan of LISP, previously
writing a dialect called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_(programming_language)">Arc</a>. He has now
come to the table with a new LISP dialect. Go see more about it on <a href="http://paulgraham.com/bel.html">his
website</a></li>
<li>Facebook&rsquo;s Hack language has been extended with a <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/10/18/hackppl/">probabilistic
programming</a> dialect.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="contributed-reads">Contributed reads</h2>

<p>Two posts this week contributed by other members (this means I have not
necessarily read these).</p>

<ul>
<li>Following a recent promotion into a DevOps post for the Data Science Campus,
Art has sent on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/the-2019-accelerate-state-of-devops-elite-performance-productivity-and-scaling">the 2019 accelerate state of
DevOps</a></li>
<li>Huw has thrown an article at us. It is a post about <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007">what things should be in
place before you even consider using
ML</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="origin-of-the-title">Origin of the title</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048424">The Night of the Hunter</a> must go down as
one of my favourite films of all time. Robert Mitchum is phenomenal and probably
the most menacing antagonist ever written.</p>
