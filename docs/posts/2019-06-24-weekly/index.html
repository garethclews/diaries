<h2 id="tools-of-the-trade">Tools of the trade</h2>

<ul>
<li>&hellip;<a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/and-voil%C3%A0-f6a2c08a4a93"><strong>et voila</strong></a>, turn your jupyter notebooks into tools for non-technical audiences. The introduction to this really gives a lot of valid reasons why jupyter notebooks are not typically as good as others tout them to be. From Project Jupyter themselves no less! I&rsquo;m not sold on this one if truth be told. It all feels a bit too <code>shiny</code> for my liking and I have never encountered anything even remotely as close to genuine computer cognition as shiny in R. It will take what you ask it to do and instead do what it wants, and rarely ever the same thing twice.</li>
<li>Convert your data into text with <a href="https://github.com/fastforwardlabs/steganos">steganos</a>. Its things like this that can help to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lyrics-site-genius-com-accuses-google-of-lifting-its-content-11560677400">protect your content</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/theindigamer/not-a-blog/blob/5ee43179fe4b148bd8c61680112b4e9e048481fc/opinionated-haskell-guide-2019.md">Learning Haskell in 2019</a> interested me because I was trying to think about how this blog would look like in other languages. For Julia its a book and there&rsquo;s no build tools, for R its all seemingly sewn up in RStudio these days (thanks Hadley) but python is the wild west with anybody with a gun claiming to be sheriff.</li>
