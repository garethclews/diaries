<h2 id="post-of-the-week">Post of the Week</h2>

<p>As 2019 is coming to an end we can expect to see plenty of &lsquo;best of the year&rsquo;
type posts but the one I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the most so far is <a href="https://blog.re-work.co/30-pieces-of-influential-ai-research-in-2019/">re•work&rsquo;s 30 influential
videos of
2019</a>.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to make time to watch them but of the ones I have so far I
have enjoyed the experience. This will be the last one of these posts until the
new year so that I can spend Christmas down-time dealing with the many
<a href="https://github.com/karetsu/diaries/issues">issues</a>, if you wish to spread the
holiday spirit then please feel free to PR and MR!</p>

<h2 id="blogs-and-commentary">Blogs and commentary</h2>

<ul>
<li>A good talk by Will Kurt (of <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com">Count Bayesie</a>
fame) introducing probability for programmers. The blurb will tell you that
the talk &lsquo;attempts to cover all of statistics in 90 minutes&rsquo; and whilst that
is really impossible it goes from 0 to generalised linear models which is
actually pretty nifty.

</div>
</li>
<li>Sticking on a mathematical theme, a recent paper equates learnability
uncertainty with some of Gödel&rsquo;s most famous work. That if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis">continuum
hypothesis</a> is true then a
small sample is sufficient to make an extrapoloation (i.e. prediction) but if
it is false then no amount of training data is ever sufficient to make
accurate estimates. This won&rsquo;t have any real effect on applications of machine
learning but should help to drive home the fact that something which is
heavily reliant on mathematics also comes a cropper of the same limitations.
Only now we have a formal proof of it.</li>
<li>Having recently re-watched The Wolf of Wall Street I found that the current
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/12/10/artificial-intelligence-is-superseding-well-paying-wall-street-jobs/#43483517524d">truth of market
traders</a>
is a far more sterile affair. Traders seem to be no more, replaced by
algorithms which is far further ahead of the game than most jobs I think.</li>
<li>Rice University have created a new model which claims to provide <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/12/mach-ai-training-linear-cost-exponential-gain/">exponential
gain for linear cost during
training</a>.
I&rsquo;m not sure if I believe it yet outside of a carefully crafted test case but
we shall have to wait and see.</li>
<li>Yoshua Bengio in an
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/artificial-intelligence/yoshua-bengio-revered-architect-of-ai-has-some-ideas-about-what-to-build-next">interview</a>
about how general intelligence might end up being a very complicated mish mash
of technologies built on top of each other and how he believes that&rsquo;s ok.
The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21010671/ai-index-report-2019-machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-data-progress">AI Index
Report</a>
suggests that general intelligence is still a very long way away, which
supports the statements made by Bengio.</li>
<li>Also from Bengio, a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sobering-message-future-ai-party/#">sobering message about the future of
AI</a>. Not
necessarily contradictory to the previous post but a statement that simply
throwing more grunt at the problem won&rsquo;t solve the real problems faced for
those working toward general intelligence.</li>
<li>The Finnish Presidency of the Council of the EU has decided to invest in
people’s future skills and will make the <a href="https://www.elementsofai.com/eu2019fi">Elements of
AI</a> online course freely available in
all official EU languages. English is now available! I wish this could give
me an excuse to visit Finland but the chances are slim.</li>
<li>The free press have started to pick up interviews with leading experts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/12/ai-end-uk-use-racially-biased-algorithms-noel-sharkey">to
curb decisions created by biased
AI</a>.
This follows on from last week&rsquo;s post about the ICO and ATI consultation and
it seems that there is growing fervour around explicability.</li>
<li>Harvard Business Review talk about <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/12/the-ai-transparency-paradox">the AI transparency
paradox</a>. I don&rsquo;t think
that this truly is a paradox so much as when providing more information about
the inner workings you open yourself up to attacks and when you disclose or
seek to understand less you can&rsquo;t be sure of why it has made a decision. Still
a valid point though.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="papers">Papers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Google Brain&rsquo;s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01603.pdf">latest paper</a> introduces
its Dreamer model. Reinforcement learning now has an &lsquo;imagination&rsquo; to predict
how things work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools-of-the-trade">Tools of the trade</h2>

<p>This week is Julia heavy, which gives away the things I have mostly been doing!</p>

<ul>
<li>Solve <a href="https://nep-pack.github.io/NonlinearEigenproblems.jl/">nonlinear eigenvalue
problems</a> with Julia.</li>
<li>Also Julia, <a href="https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl">statically sized
arrays</a>.</li>
<li>Need a dependency-free Julia alternative to
<a href="https://readxl.tidyverse.org/">readxl</a>? Try
<a href="https://github.com/felipenoris/XLSX.jl">XLSX.jl</a>.</li>
<li>Last week I mentioned Frank McSherry&rsquo;s latest effort in making timely dataflow
work by joining Materialize. This has been picked up in various other
newsletters this week and even has <a href="https://www.datacouncil.ai/talks/the-materialize-incremental-view-maintenance-engine">a talk about
it</a>.
Gathering steam behind this idea means we could be moving into territory where its usable by mere mortals!</li>
</ul>

<p>Last week I went to see A Nightmare Before Christmas live. It was phenomenal.
Here&rsquo;s the song that the lyric is taken from.</p>
