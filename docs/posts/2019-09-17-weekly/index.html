<p>A very short one this week, not a lot of reading has been done at all (blame
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_(video_game)">Control</a>!).</p>

<h2 id="commentary-and-blogs">Commentary and blogs</h2>

<p>Have you ever wondered if the people around you know how to cater to the needs
of nurturing and developing a data scientist? Well now you can throw a
<a href="https://oreilly-ds-report.s3.amazonaws.com/Care_and_Feeding_of_Data_Scientists.pdf">report</a>
in their laps and ask them to read something which will help!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://monzo.com">Monzo</a> are trying to use machine learning to help them
operate. The biggest problem they face is that they need answers yesterday.
<a href="https://nlathia.github.io/2019/08/13/Machine-learning-faster/">Here</a> one of
their employees discusses how they can develop and deliver on machine learning
insights fast enough to be useful</li>
<li>An <a href="https://www.nathanbenaich.com/blog/ai-first-biology">&lsquo;AI first&rsquo;</a> approach
to biology. I think this kind of thing may become more common amongst
experimental scientists.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="news-roundup">News roundup</h2>

<ul>
<li>The coverage of ML applications in mainstream media has steadily been growing.
Wired have recently posted about <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-can-pass-standardized-testsbut-it-would-fail-preschool/">how brittle ML models
are</a></li>
<li>Quantum searches (quantum algorithm for searching which can reduce the number
of steps for the search) may actually be a <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614259/an-important-quantum-algorithm-may-actually-be-a-property-of-nature/">property of
nature</a></li>
<li>In a related topic, we now also have the theory behind a <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-09-quantum-convolutional-neural-networks.amp">Quantum
CNN</a></li>
<li>AI is still not <em>great</em> at image classification. If we can improve it, then we
may be able to have a real effect in <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614246/ai-image-recognition-improves-disaster-response/">improving disaster
response</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<ul>
<li>As ML applications become more widespread and are used to monitor people and
their movements there is a large drive to develop countermeasures to make sure
that we don&rsquo;t end up in 1984. This <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04538">deep
privacy</a> paper is a nice start to masking
people&rsquo;s faces live.</li>
<li>Have a need to formally verify your NLP model? Try <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01492">interval bound
propogation</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools-of-the-trade">Tools of the trade</h2>

<p>Not really a technical tool this week. I was having a conversation with a friend
(IRL) who was trying their hardest to get their head around some extremely
complicated maths and were struggling to really understand it. They had never
heard of the <a href="https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/">Feynman technique</a> and
its worked wonders for them. I can imagine that it may be new to some of you as
well but it is a great way to make sure that you absolutely understand something.</p>

<h2 id="origin-of-the-title">Origin of the title</h2>

<p>You may have heard of this book, it is by Dr. Seuss and is the magnificent
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Green-Eggs-Ham-Dr-Seuss/dp/0007355912">Green Eggs and
Ham</a>. My
daughter loves listening to me trying to read it as fast as I can and flubbing
my way through the latter half!</p>
