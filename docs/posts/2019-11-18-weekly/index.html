<h2 id="post-of-the-week">Post of the week</h2>

<p>Scientific American this week published an opinion piece titled <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/ai-doesnt-actually-exist-yet/">&ldquo;AI doesn&rsquo;t
actually exist yet&rdquo;</a>. I feel like they&rsquo;re right, what a lot of businesses
purporting to utilise AI mean is that they are making use of machine learning
techniques and the same regression models we&rsquo;ve had since time immemorial. I
feel that this is also what
various other government departments mean as well, but that&rsquo;s just my view.</p>

<p>In this time of huge interest and demand for statistics based approaches to
gaining a deeper understanding of data it feels like those who do not know
enough are ploughing on ahead and waving the magic wand on our behalf. Machine
learning and &lsquo;data science&rsquo;* carry enormous caveats around their applicability
and still we plough on regardless. For example; see New Scientist&rsquo;s post (guilty
of the crime in the SciAm post) <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2222907-ai-can-predict-if-youll-die-soon-but-weve-no-idea-how-it-works/">which can predict if you will die soon</a>, but
nobody can say why it can predict it, or the furore surrounding the <a href="https://blog.fiddler.ai/2019/11/the-never-ending-issues-around-ai-and-bias-whos-to-blame-when-ai-goes-wrong/https://blog.fiddler.ai/2019/11/the-never-ending-issues-around-ai-and-bias-whos-to-blame-when-ai-goes-wrong/https://blog.fiddler.ai/2019/11/the-never-ending-issues-around-ai-and-bias-whos-to-blame-when-ai-goes-wrong/">Apple card
sexist bias</a> (also guilty).</p>

<p>It feels very much to me like the whole world is putting the cart before the
horse, and I guess this is why I have spent most of my time of late revisiting
mathematics and its literature instead. Perhaps I&rsquo;m just hitting overload and
becoming jaded ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<li>I still hate that term, I would prefer Applied Statistics and to create the
likening that it is to statistics what physics is to mathematics.</li>

<h2 id="blogs-and-commentary">Blogs and commentary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps not of immediate interest, but some physicists have stumbled across a simple
way to <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/neutrinos-lead-to-unexpected-discovery-in-basic-math-20191113/">calculate eigenvectors from eigenvalues</a>. Given how all of the
machine learning algorithms you use every day are so heavily reliant on linear
algebra under the hood this could mean we get some speed increases downstream.
If you want to see the relationship then I suggest you take a look at their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.03795.pdf">paper</a>.</li>
<li>Uber do a lot of time series predictions to try to understand their customer
base. They have recently posted how they deal with <a href="https://eng.uber.com/neural-networks-uncertainty-estimation/">uncertainty estimation</a>
whilst doing so.</li>
<li>Giving good feedback to collaborators and teammates is hugely important.
Understanding how to give feedback when you are doing code reviews is a skill we
all need to develop better. This <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/the-best-code-review-feedback-i-ever-received-43313a503517">first hand account</a> can help you focus on
the right way to go about it.</li>
<li>Tanya Reilly (of &lsquo;glue&rsquo; fame) is back and talks about the importance of
minutes. They&rsquo;re great and something I think is currently missing from the
meetings from e.g. expert group core teams (not just DaSH). Go <a href="https://noidea.dog/blog/can-somebody-take-notes">read it</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="papers">Papers</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been hitting maths papers much harder than anything else lately. Some of
them are the intersection of mathematics and computing or engineering though so
its worth sharing them here.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05625">Category theory and symplectic linear algebra as a framework for passive
linear models</a>. This is actually the favourite thing I&rsquo;ve read this week but
I would have received less catharsis posting this in Post of the Week! If you
need to brush your category theory knowledge off then this paper will help that,
if you don&rsquo;t know what category theory is then maybe give this one a miss for
now!</li>
<li><a href="http://www4.di.uminho.pt/~jno/ps/pdbc.pdf">Programming by Computation</a> is an interesting read. If you&rsquo;re interested
in the idea of producing programs by calculation out of abstract and
inefficient ones (and how this proposes that functional programming is a good
thing for teaching programming as a whole) then check it out.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools-of-the-trade">Tools of the trade</h2>

<ul>
<li>Frank McSherry is a busy man. When he&rsquo;s not jointly creating differential
privacy he has been publishing papers around differential data flow and timely
data flow. Now those papers are becoming a reality over at <a href="https://materialize.io/">materialize.io</a>
who have a streaming SQL engine that might just meet your data querying needs.
Its in closed beta at the moment but sign up if you&rsquo;re interested.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been looking into a variety of options for helping my wrists out (carpal
tunnel syndrome is pretty annoying). Now I have the right <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck">keyboard</a>
(others are available) I&rsquo;ve spent some time thinking about how may hands move
whilst on it. This led me to layouts such as dvorak and colemak (and I&rsquo;ll try
them eventually) but a more interesting topic also sprang out. The <a href="http://www.openstenoproject.org/">Open
Stenography Project</a> is looking to make stenography available to all. If
you are interested in blowing your current conception of how to type out of
the water go check it out. Sadly its all about key chords which is not for me :(</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="functional-programming-propaganda">Functional programming propaganda</h2>

<p>Only one post this week, but its a whole series of videos in one. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UyQ0fn6ke4&amp;list=PLE-CSy3N6yEd_WTossnDB7pK9wb4eJD9r">Learning
Haskell for
Dummies</a>
is a series of videos intended to get you working with Haskell without worrying
about getting a PhD in maths to understand it!</p>

<h2 id="origin-of-the-title">Origin of the title</h2>

<p>Cordyceps is a parasitic fungus. Its really cool/terrifying.</p>

<p>My interest in this is mostly out of an eagerness for The Last of Us Part 2 (as
a human attacking form of cordyceps was the reason for the clickers in the first
game).</p>
