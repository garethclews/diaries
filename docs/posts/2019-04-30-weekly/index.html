<p>Time again for me to throw a list of things that have passed by my eyes this
week. For those who are not aware I’ve also included some
links to the recent events at DataCamp where the CEO has gotten away with
sexually assaulting a member of staff and join the course developers in urging
you to boycott this service.</p>

<h2 id="the-datacamp-story">The DataCamp story</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://juliasilge.com/blog/datacamp-misconduct">https://juliasilge.com/blog/datacamp-misconduct</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ironholds.org/datacamp">https://ironholds.org/datacamp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://noamross.github.io/datacamp-sexual-assault/">https://noamross.github.io/datacamp-sexual-assault/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, back to our scheduled programming.</p>

<h2 id="r">R</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ewenme/ghibli">Ghibli movie colours schemes</a>: if you want
your graphs to remind you of some of the best animated films ever made this is
the package for you. There’s also a website built with a bit more of a
showcase than the repo allows.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="python">Python</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython">wtfpython</a>: I think the jump from
beginner to intermediate level programming in python is when you are genuinely
able to reason about why something behaves differently to what you would expect.
This is a very good curated list of such gotchas and can help many people make
this jump [credit to Arthur Eidukas for this one].</li>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/vaex-a-dataframe-with-super-strings-789b92e8d861">vaex</a>:
better string treatment (and much faster than default strings in panda
dataframes)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-quality">Data quality</h2>

<p>There were a couple of things regarding data quality this week so I have given
it its own section.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://quickbooks-engineering.intuit.com/taming-data-quality-with-circuit-breakers-dbe550d3ca78">Taming data
quality</a>:
the idea in this one is to use the idea of circuit breakers to help you assess
the quality of your data. This may also be of interest to anybody in the admin
data project hub!</li>
<li><a href="https:/towardsdatascience.com/scalable-log-analytics-with-apache-spark-a-comprehensive-case-study-2be3eb3be977">Data analytics in
spark</a>:
large scale data analytics and visualisation using spark</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="blogs-of-interest">Blogs of interest</h2>

<ul>
<li>Andrej Karpathy doesn’t blog very often but when he does they are some of <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b">my
favourite
posts</a>
in machine learning. This time he has written <a href="https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/">A Recipe for Training Neural
Networks</a> and I think this is
pretty fundamental required reading for anybody who intends to perform the
task of training an NN.</li>
<li>At times we are probably all guilty of thinking that somebody else’s problem
is trivial. Chris Done has written a good post about <a href="https://chrisdone.com/posts/teaching/">how to
avoid</a> making the people who are
experiencing these things for the first time feel stupid. Sure, its all common
sense but its good to be reminded every now and then of how hard things are
when you experience them for the first time (I think there’s a genuine Dark
Souls analogy here but I’ll leave that meme well alone).</li>
<li><a href="https://distill.pub/2019/gan-open-problems/">Open questions about GANs</a>: a
blog from a member of the Google Brain Team about questions regarding
applicability and functionality of GANs which are currently unanswered. I
quite enjoyed this one as a contrast to the “just use a GAN” type commentary
that goes on elsewhere. It really shows that we do not understand them very
well at present.</li>
<li><a href="https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html">Why programming takes longer than expected
:D</a>:
a statistical approach to explaining programming project timelines!</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/syncedreview/new-google-brain-optimizer-reduces-bert-pre-training-time-from-days-to-minutes-b454e54eda1d">BERT training times massively
reduced</a>:
Huzzah! Maybe we mere mortals without 4 days of GPU farm time/cost can
actually train a BERT model</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="papers">Papers</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/481267v1.full">Intelligible speech synthesis from neural decoding of spoken
sentences</a>: paper on
decoding speech, not much more to say other than I found it really
interesting. It might be of use to Theodore and Michaela but I’m not sure how
finished your work is on the speech stuff.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/wigner.pdf">The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural
sciences</a>: I re-read
the paper which got riffed on for a machine learning related post</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05789">Diagnosing and enhancing VAE models</a>:
understanding the underlying energy function of a variational autoencoder with
a bit more rigour than the usual treatments</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="origin-of-the-title">Origin of the title</h2>

<p>This one is pronounced &ldquo;eta conversion&rdquo; and comes as one of the important
concepts of the <a href="http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/WS03/alpi/lambda.pdf">Lambda
Calculus</a>.</p>

<p>And that is all for now. See you next week, same bat-time, same bat-channel.</p>
