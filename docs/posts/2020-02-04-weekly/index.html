<p>A bumper crop after a week &lsquo;off&rsquo; catching up on learning and life. We suffered a
bit of a setback and corruption has ruined the entire set of customisations of
the theme we are using and it was a git submodule that was never pushed.
I will have to ruminate on what to do about that. Until then we will be using a
simple theme. If you have any readability issues then hold fire on complaining
until I&rsquo;ve rebuilt. I figure some content in the meantime is better than none.</p>

<h2 id="post-of-the-week">Post of the week</h2>

<p>Machine learning is currently heralded as the great saviour of healthcare. What
happens though when the results come from flawed science? This is precisely what
has happened in the studies which have reported success in classifying expectant
mothers as likely to deliver pre-term. Instead of their 90% accuracy as claimed,
the results are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06296">little better than 50-50</a> when
treated properly.</p>

<p>How this is going to change as access to these programs gets easier but the
understanding also gets weaker is pretty scary!</p>

<h2 id="blogs-and-commentary">Blogs and commentary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mozilla give us a blog post entitled &ldquo;<a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/great-tech-great-responsibility">With Great Tech Comes Great
Responsibility</a>&rdquo;.
This guide is available to help students navigate ethical issues in the tech
industry. It makes me feel like we are missing one for data science.</li>
<li>Not so much an interesting read as it is some impactful news. OpenAI have gone
<a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-pytorch/">full PyTorch</a>. Chalk up another win for facebook!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve posted counter-surveillance links before now, but my favourite this year
so far is Simon Weckert&rsquo;s &ldquo;attack&rdquo; on Google Maps. If nothing else this should
show how easy it is to attack and manipulate large scale machine learning
applications. If team red are this easy to fool then what hope is there for us
mere mortals?

</li>
<li><a href="https://bluedot.global">BlueDot</a> scores another victory in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-epidemiologist-wuhan-public-health-warnings/">early prediction of
coronavirus</a>.
It didn&rsquo;t really help anybody though, WHO and CDC still rely on officials in
the countries affected to base their announcements. Should BlueDot become a
tool in the early prevention of such outbreaks or did it simply get lucky? We
know how <a href="https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/0314policyforumff.pdf">flu trends can cause
hysteria</a>.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve found it really interesting how the scientific media has been picking up
and discussing machine learning and &lsquo;AI&rsquo;. Scientific American are currently one
of the most vocal sources, giving us:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/ai-isnt-a-solution-to-all-our-problems/">AI isn&rsquo;t a solution to all our
problems</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/i-know-some-algorithms-are-biased-because-i-created-one/">I know some algorithms are biased - because I created one</a>
Some of this might initially feel like a knee-jerk reaction to those who feel
that &lsquo;traditional science&rsquo; is at risk (to be downplayed by ML practitioners as
such) but we can&rsquo;t overlook the fact that these do contain some good points.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Following on from the MoD contracts for £4M for defense, the UK government is
looking for practitioners of &lsquo;<a href="https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:600328-2019:TEXT:EN:HTML">general artificial
intelligence</a>&rsquo;.
I would assume that this doesn&rsquo;t mean that they want artificial general
intelligence but more that they don&rsquo;t really know what they want and this
<strong>£90M</strong> is to give recommendations on what is possible. Colour me skeptical as
to whether we will really see the benefits, but temper that with just a small
amount of hope that we do.</li>
<li>I get a little bit upset when people try to programmatically solve what are A
level mathematics problems so I sat head-in-hands when reading Vaselin Jungic&rsquo;s
experience of <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-math-teachers-plea-lets-keep-pi-irrational-127159">precisely
this</a>.
I&rsquo;m not against using computers to help understand the problem (I&rsquo;m only about
30% luddite), but it worries me no end when they are a replacement for
thinking.</li>
<li>Uh-oh spaghetti-ohs! IBM are <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/01/27/ibms_facial_recognition_software_gets_it_in_trouble_again/">being
sued</a>
because of their facial-recognition dataset essentially stealing photos from
flickr. I think they&rsquo;re in the clear on this one because of the Creative
Commons license that flickr uses in general, but with Illinois having a law
which requires them to gain written consent from the individuals involved this
is going to get a little prickly.</li>
<li>Hackaday made me really happy when I saw that students were <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/01/24/students-use-low-tech-hacks-on-high-tech-parking-enforcer/">hacking parking
enforcers</a>
even going as far as piggy-backing on its network connection to get free internet!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="propaganda">Propaganda</h2>

<ul>
<li>I discovered an <a href="https://github.com/qfpl/applied-fp-course">applied functional
programming</a> course on github. Its
pretty good and gives some good problems to tackle if you are learning an FP language.</li>
<li>If you want to become proficient with Haskell in particular, then William Yaoh
has some <a href="https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-01-11-road-to-proficient.html">recommendations for how to get
there</a>.</li>
<li>I love open problems. If I were half the mathematician I should be then my
spare time would be keeping up with attempts to win <a href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/millennium-prize-problems">Clay
prizes</a>.
Now we have a <a href="http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/decade.html">Haskell
equivalent</a>, but sadly without
the prize pot!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools-of-the-trade">Tools of the trade</h2>

<ul>
<li>I have recently discovered <a href="https://github.com/direnv/direnv">direnv</a>. This
wonderful little program lets me automatically activate nix-shells when I enter
directories and lose them when I move out. It&rsquo;s especially awesome when coupled
with <a href="https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-03-28-introducing-lorri.html">lorri</a>.</li>
<li>Not so useful in ML but I really enjoyed watching Piotr Jagielski using Clojure
to &lsquo;live program&rsquo; dance music. I&rsquo;m not really the demographic for it but being
able to programmatically implement and amend the song as its playing just
reminds me of why I love emacs (yes, he&rsquo;s using IDEA but this is how I work on
customising emacs) and lisps.

</li>
<li>Time to add yet another thing to your data vocabulary. Databricks have given us
the term <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/01/30/what-is-a-data-lakehouse.html">data
lakehouse</a>.
At least the buzzword bingo cards will be more interesting now!</li>

<p>Ahead of Netflix&rsquo;s rlease of Locke and Key I&rsquo;ve been re-reading the series.
Keyhouse is an awesome place.</p>
