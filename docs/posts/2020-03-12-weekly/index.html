<p>After an extended hiatus (which has included a visit to Ghana and some annual leave) we are back.</p>

<h2 id="topic-of-the-week-month">Topic of the <del>week</del> month</h2>

<p>Rather than a single post this time there is one topic that has come up time and
again over the last month. Data breaches. It seems that everybody is fumbling our
personal data all at the same time. Here&rsquo;s a summary of the ones which caught my eye.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2020/03/network-rail-and-c3uk-confirm-wifi-personal-data-breach.html">Network rail</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/spacex-contractor-hit-by-data/">SpaceX</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/24/samsung_data_breach_find_my_mobile/">Samsung</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/zynga-facing-lawsuit-over-data/">Zynga</a>
(the people who brought you Words with Friends)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2020-03-05/virgin-media-apologises-after-data-breach-affects-900-000-customers/">Virgin
Media</a>
which allegedly includes personal sexual preference information in the form of
requested porn website whitelist requests, what could go wrong?</li>
</ul>

<p>And with confirmation that Vodafone are <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/19/vodafone_transparency/">siphoning off your
data</a> there are
probably more which we do not yet know about but for which money is currently
changing hands. Its never been more important to understand the importance of the
value of your information and to take the steps you need to balance your security
with the utility you get by sharing it.</p>

<h2 id="non-data-science-reading">Non-data science reading</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve really not read much in the data science sphere of late and have been far
more focussed on the topic which led me to the position I&rsquo;m in. Here&rsquo;s some of my
picks that I think are most interesting to those who are not as mathematically
inclined.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m not convinced that emoji have any place in equations but that is a personal
preference. If you like the idea then there are plenty more ways to help
visualise the meaning of mathematics over <a href="https://agilescientific.com/blog/2020/2/25/visual-explanations-of-mathematics">here</a></li>
<li>A good argument that &lsquo;speaking mathematics&rsquo; is a way to <a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-03-math-code.html">better understanding
and implementations of code</a></li>
<li>So often the sciences (including computer) take from mathematics and give
nothing back. Now, a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/landmark-computer-science-proof-cascades-through-physics-and-math-20200304/">new computer science
proof</a>
directly contributes back to quantum physics and pure maths and this makes me
happy.</li>
<li>I have recently enjoyed small <a href="https://brilliant.org/daily-problems/">daily maths
challenges</a> which give you small
self-contained toy problems that are just fun to do.</li>
<li>Surprisingly,
<a href="https://phys.org/news/2020-03-parrots-probability-stats-choices.html">parrots</a>
are probably better at statistics than I am!</li>
<li>Quanta also have a pretty <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-map-of-mathematics-20200213/">map of
mathematics</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-science-reading">Data science reading</h2>

<ul>
<li>Just when you thought self-driving cars might be safe, there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615299/reinforcement-learning-adversarial-attack-gaming-ai-deepmind-alphazero-selfdriving-cars/">new
attack</a>.</li>
<li>In a shocking turn of events, people are <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615232/ai-emotion-recognition-affective-computing-hirevue-regulation-ethics/">blowing ML gains out of all
proportion</a>.
This time it is &lsquo;Emotion AI&rsquo;, the thing that people use to assess video
interviews to understand candidate suitability for e.g. jobs.</li>
</ul>
