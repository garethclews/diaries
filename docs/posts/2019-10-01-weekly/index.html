<p>I&rsquo;m back from leave. These are the things I found interesting in my week off.</p>

<h2 id="news-roundup">News roundup</h2>

<ul>
<li>Is it tragic when a computer thinks it <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614333/this-picasso-painting-had-never-been-seen-before-until-a-neural-network-painted-it/">has painted a
Picasso</a>?</li>
<li>Facebook are working hard at not only tracking everything digital about you,
they&rsquo;re also moving into the physical realm by using AI to improve the
<a href="ttps://ai.facebook.com/blog/hand-tracking-deep-neural-networks/">tracking of your hand movements for VR
headsets</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="blogs-and-research">Blogs and research</h2>

<ul>
<li>Got noisy data? Google&rsquo;s AI team think a <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/bi-tempered-logistic-loss-for-training.html">bi-tempered logistic loss
function</a>
is a good call for you!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of horror films, including all of Boris Karloff&rsquo;s monsters.
Turns out you can do some pretty neat things with <a href="https://fronkonstin.com/">hierarchical clustering as a
paintbrush for drawing images</a></li>
<li>If you think that postcode area, gender and date of birth is a suitable level
of anonymisation you may want to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613996/youre-very-easy-to-track-down-even-when-your-data-has-been-anonymized/">think
again</a>.
This work is in part done at Imperial College London, who have set up a nifty
<a href="https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/individual-risk/">live app</a> where you can see just
how unique you are within those three data points for you. FYI, Fishman can
only be identified exactly from his three points of data 63% of the time.
Guess this makes me a sardine?</li>
<li><a href="https://vicki.substack.com/p/logs-were-our-lifeblood-now-theyre">What do we do when we collect too much
data?</a> Given
the demand for all of the data, right now (although we rarely get what we
want) are we building a rod for our own backs?</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve received a few recommendations for a presentation given by Susie Lu on
visualisation and luckily for us there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.susielu.com/data-viz/abstractions">blog
post</a> about exactly that talk</li>
<li>Want to learn some maths? Want it to not make your brain melt? Here&rsquo;s a good
introduction to
<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-an-adjunction-part-1">adjunctions</a> where
you only want things to be &lsquo;pretty much&rsquo; the same - parts
<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-an-adjunction-part-2">two</a> and
<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-an-adjunction-part-3">three</a> parts of
this blog have also now been posted so you can go as deep as you want in your
understanding of this useful mathematical concept</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="books-and-papers">Books and papers</h2>

<ul>
<li>In a paper written by unknown authors there is an extension of an NLP context
tree into the world of equations, allowing for applications of <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=S1eZYeHFDS">deep learning
for symbolic mathematics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2018-bayesian-ensembles">Applications of Bayesian ensembles in NLP
tasks</a> is yet more
work toward a scientific understanding of language</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools-of-the-trade">Tools of the trade</h2>

<ul>
<li>I became aware that people around me hadn&rsquo;t heard of or used <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/media/pdf/kalman_intro.pdf">Kalman
filters</a> so I
scoured the internet for the cutest <a href="https://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/">drawings to help others understand
them</a> - I
really wish I had this resource when I was teaching the topic to undergraduates</li>
<li>A long time ago, because I&rsquo;m pretty lame, I read
<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html">SICP</a> for
&lsquo;fun&rsquo; - since then it seems that the &ldquo;wizard book&rdquo; is becoming ever more
relevant for people outside of computer science</li>
<li>Working in a purely functional language? Want an amazing way to reference
pieces of data? <a href="https://vitez.me/building-lenses">Build your own lenses</a> is a
20 step program to teach you about these abstract but awesome things, and you
don&rsquo;t even remotely need a PhD to understand it here!</li>
<li>I was reminded of a good lecture from Dan Licata in 2012 about <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/previous-semesters/2012-spring/resources/lectures/09.pdf">domain
specific
datatypes</a>,
if the content eludes you then I think that&rsquo;s ok because the absolute most
important part of this document is the opening gambit</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="origin-of-the-title">Origin of the title</h2>

<p>A slight mistake on what WSfL meant&hellip; it should have been Windows Subsystem for
Linux.</p>
