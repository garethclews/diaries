    <p>Following the recent loss of all my hard work adapting the thematic side of the
website I have made the decision to call it a day with this blog. My final post
here will be on April 24th, marking the first anniversary of the diaries. I will
be doing my best to continue weekly posts until this date.</p>

<p>Following this, I will be taking down the rendered form of the site and you can
<a href="https://github.com/karetsu/diaries">pull from the repository</a> to get the
archive. After this date it I will no longer maintain the repository, but I won&rsquo;t
delete it. I do not have the energy nor will to rebuild it - I really do not
enjoy web design or development (even if it is simply editing somebody else&rsquo;s
content).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to say thanks for sticking with us as long as you have and for all the
feedback I&rsquo;ve received along the way. It made the slog of writing up the things I
have read and seen more bearable.</p>

<p>I guess I need to add an &lsquo;origin of the title&rsquo;. This one is a quote from Robert Frost.</p>

<p>I heartily recommend that you go and check out other sources such as</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://roundup.fishtownanalytics.com/">The Data Science Roundup</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.datascienceweekly.org/">Data Science Weekly</a></li>
