<p>Seeing as I am out of the office tomorrow I’ll send my interesting things email
now to help clog your inboxes and distract you from your BAU :)</p>

<h2 id="computer-vision">Computer Vision</h2>

<p>I ended up reading more about CV than I expected in the last week (it’s one of
those Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon deals I think) and here are the best bits.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10506.pdf">Human shapes in images</a>: This is mostly
interesting because (1) it is voodoo (2) I am mostly potato shaped so would
like to see how bad it is at picking me out</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11491">Localising image classification problems</a>:
A new mechanism for image feature extraction away from convolutional layers</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="yann-le-cunn">Yann le Cunn</h2>

<p>I’ve called this by his name because it should be familiar to everybody. He
posts an awful lot of monologues about the state of machine learning and his
opinion on things on facebook and has now
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/722677142/posts/10155934004262143/">declared</a> that we
should stop using ‘unsupervised’ as a term for machine learning tasks and
instead use ‘self-supervised’. I was surprised at this because I’ve been using
self-supervised as a descriptor for about a year already!</p>

<h2 id="sound-embeddings">Sound embeddings</h2>

<p>Another one for Theo I think, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05862">this</a> paper
provides a pre-training mechanism for speech analysis by providing a vector
representation of audio forms.</p>

<h2 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h2>

<p>Rather vague section where people talk about using tools.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://colindcarroll.com/2019/04/28/choice-of-symplectic-integrator-in-hamiltonian-monte-carlo/">Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo</a>:
I previously linked through to part 2 of this tutorial, for anybody who is
following along this is the next part (I’m thoroughly enjoying this series of
posts!)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1123278380369973248">Using prophet</a>:
This tweet thread talks through Facebook’s prophet tool and is a pretty good
read to understand what it does and why it was made</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>

<p>I haven’t really settled on a format for writing these emails yet so the
sections are a bit chaotic and random. These are the other things I read which
aren’t classifiable by the above.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613432/how-a-google-street-view-image-of-your-house-predicts-your-risk-of-a-car-accident">Street View -&gt; Car accident
risk</a>:
The MIT tech review website has so many interesting posts. This is just the one
I landed on this week but it easily could’ve been anything else on that site.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.visualcinnamon.com/2019/04/mobile-vs-desktop-dataviz">Writing data visualisations for non-desktop
users</a>: I
don’t particularly care about the written content of this one – there are
various supremely pretty images in it!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SauceCat/Nuance">SauceCat</a>: Nuance is a set of ideas for
visualisation as part of data science projects that they have been involved in.
I’m totally over Sankey diagrams but if you ever wanted to draw one to picture
your decision tree structure and weights then now its super easy.</li>
<li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-does-an-ideal-data-scientists-profile-look-like-7d7bd78ff7ab">What does a data scientist look
like?</a>:
Not me, that’s for sure! For those interested in calling themselves ‘data
scientists’ this is a review of how the role has changed over the course of
its rapid ascent and what things you should be focussing on now to become
one/be called one.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="origin-of-the-title">Origin of the Title</h2>

<p>With Avengers: Endgame in cinemas I couldn&rsquo;t not.</p>

<p>That’ll do from me this time I think. If you read anything interesting, want to
take over the writing of this thing or have any suggestions then please let me
know. Until next time!</p>
