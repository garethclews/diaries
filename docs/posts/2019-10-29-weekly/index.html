<p>Blessings to you and your beloved dead, on this night when the veil is thin and
there is magick in the air.</p>

<p>Samhain is upon us and my week has mostly been taken up with preparing for
festivities with Fishman Jr so this week we have only a short selection of
content.</p>

<h2 id="post-of-the-week">Post of the week</h2>

<p>I find myself very often stressing that machine learning and AI are not a magic
wand. I&rsquo;m really quite happy that I&rsquo;ve never had to explain this to any military
body. MIT&rsquo;s Technology Review (which I have previously linked to many times)
have posted an interesting discourse about <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614497/military-artificial-intelligence-can-be-easily-and-dangerously-fooled/">how easy it is to trick military
implementations</a>.
If you never read the OpenAI post about their attempt at teaching machines to
play DotA better than people then it is worth seeing <a href="https://openai.com/five/">their description of
Five</a> first!</p>

<h2 id="blogs-and-commentary">Blogs and commentary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Google are <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/10/learning-to-smell-using-deep-learning.html">attempting to teach machines what something should smell
like</a>
based on molecular structure of the odour.</li>
<li>Netflix have released and open-sourced their <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/open-sourcing-polynote-an-ide-inspired-polyglot-notebook-7f929d3f447">polyglot
notebook</a>.
Think of this like a jupyter notebook in which each and every cell can be in a
different language. They also offer a lot more IDE features than jupyter if
you feel more comfortable in a fully fledged coding environment. I, however,
will never leave emacs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="haskell-propaganda">Haskell propaganda</h2>

<p>I am unabashedly pro-Haskell. If you want to learn a bit more about it to try to
make your own mind up then please take a look at:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://serokell.io/blog/top-software-written-in-haskell">Top software written in
Haskell</a></li>
<li>To become a little better at something it is useful to look at other people&rsquo;s
implementations. <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/best-haskell-open-source-projects">These
repositories</a> are
a great source of inspiration for problem solving</li>
<li>Beginners <a href="https://github.com/albohlabs/awesome-haskell/">resources for learning
more</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="origin-of-the-title">Origin of the title</h2>

<p>This is the first line of the first stanza from Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s The Raven. Go
