<p>Somehow I&rsquo;m getting back up to speed with my usual reading rate (despite no more hours having been added to the day) and there&rsquo;s quite a bit here this week. It is quite a wide variety of things ranging from the seriousness of ethics and environmental impact through to building castles in Minecraft so hopefully there is something for everybody!</p>

<p>I never gave the non-release of GPT-2 particularly much thought at the time that openAI made the decision not to push out their full trained model with the research paper. I wanted to let the dust settle around it and to reassess how I feel about the thought of communication warfare (started, I guess with Cambridge Analytica&rsquo;s public dethroning) and how it sits with me. This is a really deep topic so instead of rambling on for what will be pages and pages I&rsquo;ll give you the same evidence I have been reading through to make up your own minds.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m optimistic for <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">project solid</a> but not yet convinced that it will gain enough traction to really give people the power back over their data. Just this week there has been a new release which can begin to counter the effects of deep fakes - read more about it in the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614021/a-new-tool-uses-ai-to-spot-text-written-by-ai/">MIT Technology Review</a>. I believe there is also a new documentary on Netflix called The Great Hack but I&rsquo;m yet to watch it.</p>

<p>As well as data ethics, many of you will have missed my discussion at the last DaSH show and tell. I spoke about environmental impact of machine learning with horror stories taken from genuine training tasks. If you missed it, you can still catch my slides <a href="http://web.dsc.ons.gov.uk/dashSaT">here</a> but it won&rsquo;t include my explanations - if you want to read more then <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614005/ai-computing-cloud-computing-microchips/">this</a> is a good place to start. I&rsquo;m going to do my best to try not to make this a platform for preaching and to keep it as politically neutral as possible, but they are both things that I am very interested in so they could crop up quite frequently.</p>

<p>For a more generalist discussion of the problems of automated thinking then there&rsquo;s a nice post in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-hidden-costs-of-automated-thinking">The New Yorker</a> which includes talk around the intellectual debt of machine learning.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-haskell-propaganda">Weekly Haskell propaganda</h2>

<ul>
<li>Haskell now has its own <a href="https://typeclasses.com/phrasebook">phrasebook</a>. Similar to Go by Example it is in a pretty early state right now but contains enough to help you get started in my favourite language</li>
<li><a href="http://www.timphilipwilliams.com/posts/2019-07-25-minecraft.html">Generating castles in Mincraft using haskell</a> is a pretty fun way to spend a day and hopefully proof its not just for stuffy academic purposes!</li>
<li>Right fold, the <a href="https://hmemcpy.com/2019/07/right-fold-superpowers/">superhero</a>, this one is helpful for understanding right fold across most languages and not just Haskell</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="blog-comment-and-opinion">Blog, comment and opinion</h2>

<p>Geoff Hinton and Yann Le Cunn (aka the OGs) talked about the deep learning revolution at their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsnQf7exv5I">Turing Lecture</a> (the one they gave because they were awarded with the Turing prize - for which the third awardee Yoshua Bengio doesn&rsquo;t talk)</p>

<h2 id="papers">Papers</h2>

<p>Just one this week but it could turn out to be a pretty important one! Google&rsquo;s Brain team have just thrown out <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11279.pdf">a paper</a> on adding additional vectors into deep learning processes to give more understandable interpretations of what is going on in each layer. They consider a mapping from machine state to human interpretative state and directional derivatives can then provide a measure of sensitivity of understanding to that feature.</p>

<h2 id="origin-of-the-title">Origin of the title</h2>

<p>I watched this video and it was pretty cool so I played on their play of the name of Gauguin and the title is simply the name of one of his paintings, before he was able to work as a full time painter and sculptor.</p>
