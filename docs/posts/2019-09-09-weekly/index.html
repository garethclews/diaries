<p>An airport nightmare in the US gave me plenty of time to read things. This is a
somewhat themed chronicle of my time in Orlando International Airport.</p>

<h2 id="commentary-and-blogs">Commentary and Blogs</h2>

<p>Typically this section is just a monster list of bullet points. This week we
actually have some well defined themes to break this up into.</p>

<h3 id="health">Health</h3>

<p>Ok, a little bit of a loose collection of things including psychology and
biology.</p>

<ul>
<li>An open challenge from Dr. Michael Joyner, if society really think that
machines can be used for improving healthcare then <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/08/28/artificial-intelligence-medicine-turing-test-obesity/">prove it by creating a
weightloss plan for obese patients which
works</a></li>
<li>Similarly, Forbes describe how machine power <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2019/08/23/ai-and-healthcare-is-the-bloom-finally-off-the-rose/#68ae12e765fc">cannot solve social and
political
problems</a>
affecting healthcare.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.floydhub.com/exploring-dna-with-deep-learning/">Population genetics with
AI</a>. Even if you
don&rsquo;t read this then think of that awesome Jurassic Park video with the genes
of frogs.

</div>
</li>
<li>Not so much health related, but a nice
<a href="https://medium.com/syncedreview/humans-dont-realize-how-biased-they-are-until-ai-reproduces-the-same-bias-says-unesco-ai-chair-9968bb1f5da8">interview</a>
with John Shawe-Taylor (you may not know the name but SVMs wouldn&rsquo;t be what
they are now without his contributions) who is now the chair for artificial
intelligence for UNESCO.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ethics">Ethics</h2>

<p>With my previous posts on environment and ethics you should not be surprised to
see a short section here with posts I have read around these types of topics. I
am not saying that I agree with every word they say but I did enjoy reading them
and hope that you can make your own decisions.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eye-on.ai/podcast-020">Podcast</a> on the environment</li>
<li>The title sounds hilarious, but <a href="https://theconversation.com/singularity-how-governments-can-halt-the-rise-of-unfriendly-unstoppable-super-ai-121999">this
post</a>
is really around the need for preventing AI from widening the monetary
imbalances between large corporations (e.g. Google, Facebook) and the rest of
whatever country they operate in</li>
<li>Some fun in counter AI <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/13/the-fashion-line-designed-to-trick-surveillance-cameras">surveillance</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="news-roundup">News roundup</h2>

<ul>
<li>In the least surprising news ever, Facebook had people listening in on
<a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/08/14/facebook_messenger_conversations/">conversations</a>
to better train their models</li>
<li>Mustafa Sulyeman placed on <a href="https://insights.dice.com/2019/08/23/alphabet-deepmind-deep-trouble/">administrative
leave</a>
from DeepMind</li>
<li>YouTube algorithms are <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/08/26/ai_roundup_230819/">pretty
crap</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="blogs-and-research">Blogs and research</h2>

<ul>
<li>Google&rsquo;s newest attempt at <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/joint-speech-recognition-and-speaker.html">voice
transcription</a>
but I&rsquo;m not sure if
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/nvidia-breaks-records-in-training-and-inference-for-real-time-conversational-ai/">nVidia&rsquo;s</a>
beats it for real time conversational AI but the use cases for it took a knock
because Google&rsquo;s hate speech detection algorithms are <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2213064-googles-hate-speech-detecting-ai-appears-to-be-racially-biased/">racially
biased</a></li>
<li><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaaw4967">Deep learning on biological
phenotypes</a></li>
<li>New ways to <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-08-ai-plot-green-route-nylon.html">synthesise nylon in an environmentally friendly
way</a></li>
<li>ADAM finally gets
<a href="https://medium.com/@lessw/new-state-of-the-art-ai-optimizer-rectified-adam-radam-5d854730807b">rectified</a></li>
<li>Adding GAN selection to the AutoML family with

</ul>

<h2 id="books-and-papers">Books and papers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Enjoy this free book on <a href="https://mml-book.github.io">mathematics for machine
learning</a>. This is for those for whom Bishop&rsquo;s
tome is a little too intimidating.</li>
<li>Similarly, I found a paper giving a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05526">selective overview of deep
learning</a>. This is almost a &lsquo;state of the
art for deep learning&rsquo; and will probably be out of date before the end of the
year given the rate at which new tools and approaches are appearing!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools-of-the-trade">Tools of the trade</h2>

<ul>
<li>I found a new shell, which is a <a href="https://xon.sh">shell</a> (pronounce it the same
as conch) - its actually a superset of python 3.5+ so you can do python things
in a shell</li>
<li>Spark and Kubernetes in the cloud with
<a href="https://medium.com/prophecy-io/introducing-prophecy-io-cloud-native-data-engineering-1b9247596030">prophecy.io</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="haskell-propaganda">Haskell propaganda</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you ever wanted to know more about the type system for lambda calculus then
look <a href="https://morgenthum.tech/articles/write-haskell-game">no further</a></li>
<li><a href="https://typeclasses.com/python">Transitioning from python to haskell</a> is a
series of pages describing how some functional programming ideas are
implemented in python and eventually how much better they are when working in
haskell</li>
<li>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make games in FP because they are all about state&rdquo;, actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_2008_presidential_campaign#Slogan">Yes
We
Can!</a>
by looking

</ul>
