<p>It’s that time of the week again. Here are the things I’ve read which I
thought were interesting and a few code repositories I think you might want to
keep an eye on.</p>

<h2 id="blogs-and-reports">Blogs and reports</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://hbr.org/2019/05/do-your-data-scientists-know-the-why-behind-their-work">Do you know the ‘why’ behind what you
do?</a>:
Harvard Business Review post talking about what skills tend to be lacking but
are very important in the success of data science projects</li>
<li><a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-as-tensor-network-diagrams">Tensor incidence
matrices</a>:
Matrix applications in graph theory, but for tensors</li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/syncedreview/alan-turing-institute-releases-ml-framework-written-in-julia-ac649f7c1f04">Julia ML
framework</a>:
The Alan Turing Institute have been hard at work making all of the ML bits and
pieces they need available in Julia. Some of these are calls to python and R
programs but that’s a good thing about Julia (it’s a great language!)</li>
<li><a href="https://davidsmale.netlify.com/portfolio/customising-ggplot2-graphics/">Customising ggplot2
graphics</a>:
This one makes my list purely because it rates dragonball. Turn your ggplot
graphics from their basic form into SSJ2.</li>
<li><a href="https://rtask.thinkr.fr/">The R Taskforce</a>: Some French R users have created
a task team, over time this website should become really useful for R fans.</li>
<li><a href="https://avantlive.wordpress.com/2019/04/29/fathoming-the-deep-in-deep-learning-a-practical-approach/">Thoughtful
impressions</a>:
Fathoming the ‘deep’ in deep learning. Warning: this uses introductory level
calculus to explain it, if you don’t know what an integral is be prepared to
take more time in getting through it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.8451.com/blog/linux-for-data-scientists-part-1">Linux for data
scientists</a>: This
is the first part of hopefully many which can tell you what useful tools you
have at your disposal without needing to fire up a programming interface.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/">What nobody tells you about
documentation</a>: This one has lots
of great info for helping you to understand what ‘documentation’ means. It’s
not as simple as you think but if you can think of it starting from this
4-partition approach and make it work for you the use and quality of your docs
will go up!</li>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/gb/blog/railyard-training-models">Railyard’s model
training</a>: How kubernetes
can help you to train models quickly. This is useful now because (1) the
office have this available (2) you can integrate it into your gitlab workflow.</li>
<li><a href="https://a16z.com/2019/05/09/data-network-effects-moats/">The empty promise of data
moats</a>: Trying not to
be cynical I think we, as an office, have been guilty of treating data as a
magical moat and not focusing on what gives us an actual win. This is a really
good walk through of how to be better about that.</li>
<li><a href="https://edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql/">EdgeDB</a>: A new contender
for SQL’s throne, I think it’s actually some pretty neat tech and the
improvements they talk about are ones which would improve my SQL life.</li>
<li><a href="https://meltingasphalt.com/interactive/going-critical/">Going critical</a>:
Diffusion + networks, for anybody who is interested in epidemiology models</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="repositories">Repositories</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/interpret">Interpret machine learning programs</a>
with Microsoft’s latest project</li>
<li>Awesome lists are probably something you are familiar with,
<a href="https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/awesome-decision-tree-papers">here’s</a>
one for Huw for decision tree papers!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/machinelearningmindset/machine-learning-course">Machine learning
mindset</a>: A
machine learning course in python. It seems pretty snazzy but I haven’t looked
at it in very much detail. Could be a useful resource for some.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/noamross/redoc">Reversible reproducible documents</a>: 2-way
Rmd &lt;-&gt; word workflow</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="papers">Papers</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00284">CocoGan</a>: Generating images in a more human
way.</li>
</ul>
