  title : What this is
  content : Welcome to The Fishman Diaries. A newsletter for my local statistics
            and machine learning community of interest.
            There are much, much better newsletters and points of interest than this one -
            and very frequently the content overlaps. Where I use the content from those I am
            subscribed to I use the utm info to respect the redirect.


            Better alternatives include (but are not limited to)
            [The Data Science Roundup](https://roundup.fishtownanalytics.com/) and
            [Data Science Weekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/)

  title : Opinionated
  content : All views are those of the authors and do not represent the views of
            any organisation.


            Standard weekly posts are demarcated by The
            Creature from the Blue Lagoon whilst guest posts are shown by the Chinese
            Wildman monster from Big Trouble in Little China.

  title : Our origin story
  content : Whilst attempting to decide on a name for our little group there was an online
            straw poll. One response came from `fish_man_168` and the name stuck. Note that no
            individual is Fishman and that he is instead the mascot of our community,
            although at times where we purport to be this is simply for effect.


            Our logo is not our own, it is the Flying Hellfish logo from The Simpsons.
