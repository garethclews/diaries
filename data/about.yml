  title : What this is
  content : A collection of interesting posts and articles relating to
            statistics, mathematics, programming and machine learning. This page
            is for the use of members of these communities at the UK's Office
            for National Statistics but all are welcome.


            There are much, much better newsletters and points of interest than this one -
            and very frequently the content overlaps. Where I use the content from those I am
            subscribed to the utm info is included to respect the redirect.


            Better alternatives include (but are not limited to)
            [The Data Science Roundup](https://roundup.fishtownanalytics.com/) and
            [Data Science Weekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/)

  content : All views are those of the authors and do not represent the views of
            any organisation.


            Standard weekly posts are demarcated by The
            Creature from the Blue Lagoon whilst guest posts are shown by the Chinese
            Wildman monster from Big Trouble in Little China.

  title : Our origin story
  content : Whilst attempting to decide on a name for our little group there was an online
            straw poll. One response came from `fish_man_168` and the name stuck. Note that no
            individual is Fishman and that he is instead the mascot of our community,
            although at times where we purport to be fishman, this is simply for effect.


            Our logo is not our own, it is the Flying Hellfish logo from The Simpsons.
